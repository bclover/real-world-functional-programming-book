Functional Programming will change your life, but not necessarily for the better. I'm happy I continue to learn more about it, and feel is has drastically improved my ability to write reliable code. Unit tests are easier to write. It is a different way of thinking about code, and will change the way you look at code once you learn it. There is no going back.\nLike the time I learned Object Oriented Programming, or Design Patterns, or Model View Controller frameworks, you see the world in a new way. You have a new hammer and everything becomes a nail. You know the \"one true way\" and you struggle to reconcile the new way with the ways of old.\nExcept it's different this time. Once you learn FP, you'll struggle to explain it to other coders and friends who may be entrenched in Imperative or OOP, but are curious about FP. Your code will start to look alien to non-FP'ers. Unless you're around other FP'ers, or those wishing to learn FP, you'll feel alone.\nI feel it's worth it. Just be aware the above will happen and prepare yourself mentally.\nThe Elevator Pitch\nWhat if I told you you could write JavaScript that doesn't throw errors, requires no mocks for unit testing, and you never have to memorize a this rule again? No undefined is not a function, no Sinon spies, and never using class or bind again, just building functions that work. You can instead focus on testing if your code is correct vs. if it mostly works and hopefully doesn't explode.\nWhat's the catch? In JavaScript, most of the code you use isn't yours and comes from the Node Package Manager called npm. The library most likely uses throw intentionally, uses classes and inheritance, and isn't written in FP style. Front-end web development frameworks like React & Angular are not 100% functional. You'll have to not only write your own functional style code, but learn how to deal with non-functional code, in a functional way. While the 100% black box unit test coverage is easier to attain in FP code, you'll still have bugs or code that isn't correctly working.\nBeyond that, no catch.\nWhat Does \"Real-World\" Mean?\nLanguages like JavaScript, Python, and Java are languages you can get a job using at the time of this writing. They're all used in web development, data science & machine learning, and building REST API's. You can use them and work with non-functional programmers in the same code base and library ecosystem. While it's slowly changing, it currently is hard to get a job using functional languages. Tech industry interviews are broken hiring for what someone perceives you know with their bias vs hiring for helping someone learn. Companies hire for someone knowing a particular language or framework vs. ability to learn new ones. Many managers are afraid to use non-standard languages because they don't think they can hire people to maintain the code base if you or your FP co-workers leave. Not everyone wants to learn FP just like I'm currently suffering at my job learning and using Go #datEntitlement.\nThis guide is meant to teach you concepts you can use to benefit your current work in \"normal\" programming languages as well as ensuring you still can get a job \"using Java\" if you wish. Part of the skill, and challenge, of using FP in the current climate is co-existing with non-functional programmers in non-functional programming languages. The good news is that JavaScript, Python, and other dynamic languages have all you need built into the language to start programming FP while co-existing with code that isn't FP. Even strongly typed class ones like Java and C# do as well.\nReal-World Functional Programming\nThis book will teach you all you need to know to start using Functional Programming in the code you write in your day to day job. We will cover all the basics, what to practice to get better, and how to compose entire programs. Lastly, we'll give you various strategies for easing it into existing codebases and teams. We'll cover it from both back-end and front end perspectives.\nWhile our examples are in dynamic, interpreted languages like JavaScript, Python, and Lua, you can use in any language that has functions with inputs, outputs, and higher order functions. We'll show examples from other languages that help corroborate existing concepts such as Go error handling and Elixir matching syntax.\nAssumed Knowledge\nThis book assumes you know the basics of programming. You know what procedural/imperative line by line code is like such as bash, you're at least familiar with Object Oriented Programming like C# or Java, and have written some unit tests at least once in your life. We also assume you know how functions, scope, and closures work in JavaScript, Python, or Lua, although we'll do a refresher on closures since they are extremely important.\nUsing This Book\nYou are welcome to skip around the sections. However, we encourage you to read the pure function section at least once. The most important concept, and implementation details of Functional Programming are based on pure functions.\nWhat We're Not Going To Cover\nTo keep things simple, we're not going to cover anything with strong types, nor Category Theory. While you'll reap some of the benefits of Category Theory in what you'll learn here, we're not covering Functors or Monads for example.  If you wish to learn more about Category Theory in a pragmatic way, check out Dr Boolean's Mostly Adequate Guide. If you wish to learn more about strong types, check out language documentation that supports functional programming with strong typing such as Elm, PureScript,TypeScript, or Flow.\nWe're also not going to cover effect handling such as Algebraic Effects which is what React Hooks are based on. For JavaScript, we'll just use Promises. However, frameworks like Redux, Saga, Calmm, or even the architecture of Elm handle it in a more pure way if you're interested.\nNomenclature\nComing from an art background and not a computer science one, I tend to abuse terms or use many interchangeably. Below are definitions of commonly used ones throughout the book that while may make sense in context, can possibly be confusing if not clear exactly what one means.\narguments / parameters\nFunctions take in arguments and sometimes return values. The arguments are the named variables between the paranethesis:\nfunction gimmeDat(bass) {\n    ...\n}\n\nIn this case, the function gimmeDat takes 1 argument, bass. I'll often call that \"arguments\" or \"parameters\" which both effectively mean the same thing as far as this book is concerned.\nshell / bash\nWhen you open a terminal, such as a Command Prompt on Windows or a Terminal in Mac or Linux, you typically write \"shell code\" in a \"bash window\". When we refer to \"shell\" or \"bash\", we're talking about writing commands in that terminal window.\n\nJust run npm install\n\nMeans open a Terminal, cd to the directory of where your code is, and type npm install and press Enter to execute that command.\nFormatting Assumptions\nBelow are explanations around how certain code is formatted through this book.\nCode\nWhen referring to code specific things like a function, we'll write the function like that. This implys it is code.\nBash, Shell, and Terminal\nWhen referering to shell/bash/terminal, we'll wrap commands with similiar syntax like running npm install or cd'ing (change directory).\nOperation or NOOP\nAn operation that takes inputs and that may return an output is called a function. However, some languages distuinguish between them. They'll say an operation is a function that takes an input but operates on the data and doesn't return anything. In that sense, console.log would be an operation whereas a function would be Math.abs.\nHowever, there is something called a \"Noop\" or \"No Opt\" which is slang for \"No operation\". This is a function that takes an input, but doesn't return a value. In that sense, console.log would be a Noop. Completely backwards, I know.\nWhatever you call them, we try to avoid using Noops in Functional Programming: functions that do not return values. Typically Noops have side effects which is what we try to avoid or push to the sides of our code.\nCode Foramtting\nWhen writing code, we'll either do it short form like const yoDog = () => console.log('sup!') or long form like:\nconst yoDog = () => console.log('sup!')\n\nStrings\nWe use single ' and double \" quotes interchangeably and each one has the same meaning: it's a String. We only whip out the template strings when building larger strings through dynamic data:\nconst you = \"You are \"\nconst amaze = \"awesome!\"\nconst bigOleMessage = `${you}${amaze}`\n\nLogging\nWe'll vary between 3 forms of logging to show you the values of variables and return values of functions. Sometimes we'll be explicit via console.log and the value commented out to the right of the console.log:\nconst MAX_TREBLE = 100\nconst maxTheTreble () => MAX_TREBLE\nconsole.log(maxTheTreble) // 100\n\nOther times we'll just use log:\nconst log = console.log\nconst MAX_TREBLE = 100\nconst maxTheTreble () => MAX_TREBLE\nlog(maxTheTreble) // 100\n\nOther times, we'll just write the commented result next to the function itself:\nconst maxTheTreble () => MAX_TREBLE // 100\n\nBut often below it:\nconst maxTheTreble () => MAX_TREBLE\n// 100\n\nRepeating Code\nIn order to reduce how much code you have to look at and so we can focus on core ideas, we'll often imply \"the code we already covered, but I'm not writing again\" or \"code is here, but we don't care about it for what we're currently talking about\".\nFor example, in the above, we'll write:\nconst MAX_TREBLE = 100\nconst maxTheTreble () => MAX_TREBLE\n\nAnd then later, talking about the same code, but 1 addition to it, we'll replace the stuff we already saw with ellipsis (3 dots):\n...\nconsole.log(maxTheTreble()) // 100\n\nThis includes function bodies. The below function, we don't care about the implementation, so we just put an ellispsis in there to imply \"there is code in here, but it's not important to focus on right now\": \nconst someComplicatedFunction = () => {\n    ...\n}\n\nArguments No One Cares About vs. Catch All\nSome functions will give arguments that we'll never use. Some linters in JavaScript don't allow you to define variables and parameters that aren't used, whereas some Type systems like TypeScript don't allow you to define callbacks that don't follow the type signature thus requiring you define the variable to satisfy the type signature even though you're not going to use it.\nFor us, we just follow the Elixir and Elm way of doing things using an underscore _:\nconst validateAlotOfData = data =>\n    validate(data)\n    .matchWith({\n        Success: _ => coolDoOtherThings()\n        , Failure: error => reportError(error)\n    })\n\nNote in the above, we don't care about the details of a successful validation. If it validated, that's good enough for us, no need to care about the value so we just use _ to imply it's there.\nFor Underscore or Lodash fans, this can be confusing and imply you're passing the Lodash object as a parameter. We're not, we simply are saying there is an argument here, but we don't care about it.\nIn Elixir and Elm, it can have double meanings such as \"I don't care\" or \"everything else, catch all, the default\". For example, here is an Elixir case statement interpreting some commandline input:  \ncase input do\n    \"sup\" ->\n        \"sup yo!\"\n    \"dude\" ->\n        \"duuuude....\"\n    \"humor me\" ->\n        \"Two guys walk into bar, the 3rd one ducks.\"\n    _ ->\n        \"Unknown input.\"\n\nThe _ in this case operates just like a default would in a JavaScript switch statement:\nswitch(input) {\n    case \"sup\":\n        return \"sup yo!\"\n    case \"dude\":\n        return \"duuuude....\"\n    case \"humor me\":\n        return \"Two guys walk into bar, the 3rd one ducks.\"\n    default:\n        return \"Unknown input.\"\n}\n\nFunction Alignment\nFor small functions, we'll write them like this, const yo = () => 'sup' inline in the setence. However, you'll sometimes see those 1 line functions on 2 lines:\nconst yo = () =>\n    'sup'\n\nvs. how it was shown inline:\nconst yo = () => 'sup'\n\nWe try to follow the Elm styling around functions where you put the function definition on the first line, then the function body on the second. This includes manually curried functions like:\nconst ping = request => url =>\n    request.get(url)\n\nWhat the heck is wrong with your comma placement?\nFor lists or manual function arguments, you'll see the commas placed in in front of the items like this:\nconst peeps =\n    [\n        \"Jesse\"\n        , \"Brandy\"\n        , \"Sydney\"\n        , \"Rowan\"\n        , \"Albus\"\n    ]\n\nInstead of how it's normally shown in JavaScript / Python / Lua:\nconst peeps =\n    [\n        \"Jesse\",\n        \"Brandy\",\n        \"Sydney\",\n        \"Rowan\",\n        \"Albus\"\n    ]\n\nPutting that on the same line allows you to comment things out when you want to play with data:\nconst peeps =\n    [\n        \"Jesse\"\n        , \"Brandy\"\n        // , \"Sydney\"\n        , \"Rowan\"\n        // , \"Albus\"\n    ]\n\n"},"part1/":{"url":"part1/","title":"Part 1: Pure Functions","keywords":"","body":"Pure Functions\nThis is the most important section of the entire book. If you're in a hurry or have a short attention span, only read this part.\nPure Functions are functions that given the same input, they'll give the same output, and have no side effects. A function that takes some arguments will always return the same value and not be affected by variables outside the function, nor will it change variables outside of it. They are the core foundation of all Functional Programming. They are the reason unit tests in FP don't need to use mocks. You don't need to look elsewhere to see what the function did. Instead, you just look at the return value of the function.\nThey are also surprisingly flexible in their application despite their definition clearly stating that \"1 plus 1 equals 2\". Many programmers, even those who use FP languages and espouse the benefits, can be lax in how \"pure\" their code truly is, myself included. Making things too pure is where you'll often see criticism of FP. Ensuring your code is as pure as possible can still lead to software that doesn't work.\nMaking your code knowingly less pure is fine. At first you won't have a choice because you won't know any better. Later once you're skilled, you'll recognize the pain and time it'll take to follow the rules and make the right call that it's not worth it. Calling this technical debt in code review doesn't always fly, though, as sometimes the library author or team has their own level of purity they're willing to go. Sometimes libraries and techniques simply don't exist or are not ready to use yet, such as Hooks in React version 17, but your team is using version 16. Your team must use classes which have side effects instead of functions.\nThe level of purity you should do is like doing Yoga. You should feel the stretch, but it shouldn't hurt. In the beginning though, evertyhing hurts, heh!\nWhat We'll Cover\nWe'll first cover the 2 rules of same input, same output and the no side effects. In dynamic languages, these rules can be more easily and stealthily broken.\nOnce you learn function purity and immutability, you'll realize that you're only allowed to use constants instead of variables. We'll cover how you can use them safely.\nWe'll take an error quest and explore ways in which errors uniquely break function purity. A lot of programming is based around exceptions happening and inspecting the stack trace to debug. That's not how Functional Programming works. We'll show you why, how to avoid them, and what to do instead. \nJavaScript, Python, and Lua allow Procedural, Object Oriented, and Functional Programming styles. That's why they're so widely used; everyone can play. However, there are a lot of constructs that aren't allowed. We'll cover what isn't allowed, and strategies for using them if you must as well as caveats for unit testing around them. You're going to work with non-FP programmers writing non-FP code using non-FP libraries, so this is a survival guide.\nFinally we'll show you how to practice writing pure functions to get better at creating, and recognizing levels of purity. I started my Functional Programming learning journey by writing predicates for a security library. It helps you understand the core parts of your language, see how they can affect purity, yet they are super simple functions so you don't overload your brain as you learn the secrets of the universe.\nAnother way to practice is to write unit tests for those predicates. If you have experience writing unit tests for non-FP code, this might be the most rewarding part for you to see how FP can make your life easier, and your test code smaller and easier to maintain.\n"},"part1/input_output_side_effects.html":{"url":"part1/input_output_side_effects.html","title":"Same Input, Same Output, No Side Effects","keywords":"","body":"Pure Functions: Same Input, Same Output, No Side Effects\nA pure function is a function that will always give the same output with the same input and has no side effects. A function that takes some arguments will always return the same value and not be affected by variables outside the function, nor will it change variables outside of it after it's done executing.\nSame Input, Same Output\nBelow we'll show an impure and a pure version of an addition function. Learning the rules is one thing, seeing how they are broken, and how you fix code to not break the rules is key. I promise this is the only math function this book has.\nImpure Add\nThis function that will add 2 numbers plus whatever data equals.\nlet data = 0\nconst add = (a, b) => a + b + data\n\nIf we call it three times, it may look like it's same input, same output:\nadd(1, 2) // 3\nadd(1, 2) // 3\nadd(1, 2) // 3\n\nHowever, if we change the value of the data variable and call the function again:\nadd(1, 2) // 3\nadd(1, 2) // 3\nadd(1, 2) // 3\ndata = 1\nadd(1, 2) // 4\nadd(1, 2) // 4\nadd(1, 2) // 4\n\nNow it's 4. Same input, not the same output. It's affected by things outside of the function.\nPure Add\nSolution: Ignore the outside world.\nTo make it pure, it needs to ignore the outside world. We can only add things that are passed into the function via the arguments. Here is the pure version of add.\nconst addPure = (a, b) => a + b\n\nIf we call addPure(1, 2), it will always return 3.\nlet data = 0\naddPure(1, 2) // 3\naddPure(1, 2) // 3\naddPure(1, 2) // 3\n\nIf we set the data variable to 5:\nlet data = 0\naddPure(1, 2) // 3\naddPure(1, 2) // 3\naddPure(1, 2) // 3\ndata = 5\naddPure(1, 2) // 3\naddPure(1, 2) // 3\naddPure(1, 2) // 3\n\nWe'll still follow the first rule of same input, same output.\nOutside Effects\nSide effects can be both outside and inside. Below is a function with NO inputs can still be affected by things happening outside of the function.\nImpure isCow\nHere we have a variable that's a cow emoji:\nfriend = 'üêÆ'\n\nAnd here we have a function that detects if it's a cow or not:\nconst isCow = () => {\n    if(friend === 'üêÆ') {\n        return true\n    } else {\n        return false\n    }\n}\n\nIf we call it three times, it'll follow the first rule of same input, same output. In this case, no input will equal true:\nisCow() // true\nisCow() // true\nisCow() // true\n\nHowever, if we change person to a chicken and then call it, we get a false back:\nfriend = 'üêÆ'\nisCow() // true\nisCow() // true\nisCow() // true\nfriend = 'üêî'\nisCow() // false\nisCow() // false\nisCow() // false\n\nEven with no inputs, this function still fails to follow the rules of same input, same output. Even no input, it still returns a different value because it's affected by \"effects\", or a variable changing, outside of itself.\nPure isCow\nSolution: Pass in the outside world through function arguments.\nThe add function was made by pure by ignoring the outside world. However, isCow needs to know about the outside world so it can report if the friend is a cow or not. The only way inside a pure function is through its arguments. We'll pass the friend in:\nconst isCowPure = friendObject => {\n    if(friendObject === 'üêÆ') {\n        return true\n    } else {\n        return false\n    }\n}\n\nNow when we call it and pass in the outside world:\nfriend = 'üêÆ'\nisCow('üêÆ') // true\nisCow('üêÆ') // true\nisCow('üêÆ') // true\nfriend = 'üêî'\nisCow('üêÆ') // true\nisCow('üêÆ') // true\nisCow('üêÆ') // true\n\nSince we pass the outside world in, the function can still report on it, and still not by affected what happens outside. It follows the rules of same input, same output, no side effects.\nInside Effects\nThe 2nd rule of no side effects applies not just to the outside world affecting the function, but also the function affecting the outside world. If \"the world\" changes after a function ran, it probably has side effects.\nImpure haveBirthday\nHere is an example of how the function can affect the outside world after it has run.\nThis person Object starts at the age of 18:\nvar person = {\n    age: 18\n}\n\nFor the person to have a birthday, we have to increment the age. We're trying to be pure, so we follow the example above and pass in the outside world into the function via its arguments:\nconst haveBirthday = person => {\n    person.age += 1\n    return person\n}\n\nWhile the person does have its age incremented:\nconsole.log(person) // { age: 18 }\nconsole.log(haveBirthday(person)) // { age: 19 }\nconsole.log(person) // { age: 19 }\nconsole.log(haveBirthday(person)) // { age: 20 }\nconsole.log(person) // { age: 20 }\nconsole.log(haveBirthday(person)) // { age: 20 }\nconsole.log(person) // { age: 21 }\n\nThe world was affected by the function running. The person's age was changed after the function run. Notice it keeps changing the world each time it is run. This function appears to follow the same input, same output rule, though:\nconsole.log(haveBirthday( { age: 18 } )) // { age: 19 }\nconsole.log(haveBirthday( { age: 18 } )) // { age: 19 }\nconsole.log(haveBirthday( { age: 18 } )) // { age: 19 }\n\nPure haveBirthday:\nSolution: Do not mutate data, use immutable data instead.\nThe haveBirthday function mutates the person Object. Although it was passed in, most Objects are dynamic languages are by reference. You affect one reference, you affect the Object and all the references that point to that Object will update to show the changes. Think of it like a global variable.\nThe way you fix it is not to mutate data. The easiest way to do that is to clone Objects and only change 1 property on the clone.\nconst haveBirthdayPure = personObject => {\n    const clone = {...person, age: personObject + 1}\n    return clone\n}\n\nNow when you run it, it follows both the same input, same output rule AND not affecting the outside world after it has been run:\nconsole.log(person) // { age: 18 }\nconsole.log(haveBirthdayPure(person)) // { age: 19 }\nconsole.log(person) // { age: 18 }\nconsole.log(haveBirthdayPure(person)) // { age: 19 }\nconsole.log(person) // { age: 18 }\nconsole.log(haveBirthdayPure(person)) // { age: 19 }\nconsole.log(person) // { age: 18 }\n\nConclusions\nYou've learned the 2 rules pure functions must follow:\n\nsame input, same output\nno side effects\n\nTo ensure same input, same output, functions must only deal with data that came from their parameters. Pure functions must ignore the outside world.\nIf there is something in the outside world like a global variable, closure variable, or even a module that the function needs to work, it MUST be passed in via the arguments, else it will violate rule #1.\nYou've learned that passing in the outside world through function parameters is not enough. If you mutate the data while it is inside the function, or call other impure functions that do, you can affect the outside after the function is run. This will violate rule #2. To solve that, you must not mutate data, and instead use immutable data.\n"},"part1/var_and_let.html":{"url":"part1/var_and_let.html","title":"The Case for var and let","keywords":"","body":"Et tu const?\nIf a function mutates data that is passed into it, it will affect the outside world, failing to follow the 2nd pure function rule of no side effects. The world, variables and data defined outside of the function, should not change after a function is run. Does that mean var, let, and possibly even const are off limits?\nThey are not off limits. Just use them inside a pure function.\nPlaying & Thinking in Procedural\nA lot of time in programming, we're writing procedural code and storing those results in local variables. Local variables are variables only used for the life of the function, and are intentionally put there to be used by a closure. This could be for a variety of reasons.\n\nplaying with ideas\nteaching\nworking on a complicated algorithm and want instant feedback\nwant to easily debug or log each line or to inspect variables\neasier for you to think and build code this way vs. \"ALL PURE FUNCTIONS\"\n\nFor example, here is parsing URL parameters manually instead of using a library:\nconst log = console.log\nconst url = \"/api/search?name=jesse\"\nlet query = url.split('?')\nlog(query) // [ '/api/search', 'name=jesse' ]\nquery = query[1]\nlog(query) // name=jesse\nquery = query.split('=')\nconst key = query[0]\nconst value = query[1]\nquery = {[key]: value}\nlog(query) // { name: 'jesse' }\n\nIt's really easy and quick to create temporary let and const variables in a procedural way to play with ideas. You can log each line to see exactly what is happening to learn or find mistakes.\nPure lets\nSolution: Follow the pure function rules and you're fine.\nThis behavior and style of writing is still encouraged. Many of us coming from Imperative backgrounds thinking in terms of \"how\" something should work vs. \"what\" should happen. If this mode of thinking is easier for you, go for it! You can still write this way and keep things pure if you just follow the 2 rules. Let's take the above and make it mostly pure.\nconst log = console.log\nconst url = \"/api/search?name=jesse\"\n\nconst parseQuery = url => {\n    let query = url.split('?')\n    log(query) // [ '/api/search', 'name=jesse' ]\n    query = query[1]\n    log(query) // name=jesse\n    query = query.split('=')\n    const key = query[0]\n    const value = query[1]\n    query = {[key]: value}\n    log(query) // { name: 'jesse' }\n    return query\n}\nlog(parseQuery(url)) // { name: 'jesse' }\n\nCopy pasta coding! Notice that we just copy and pasted the code. It follows the same input, same output rule. The outside world part we need, the url, is passed into the arguments. The query, although it's a let variable, it only exists for the life of the function and doesn't affect the outside world. Same for the key and value are constants, but they too only exist inside the function. \nThe log technically breaks the being affected by the outside world, and affecting the world after its run. He's a noop, though, a function that returns no value so we assume it \"does no operation\". You'll start to develop a 6th sense when you see noops, they probably indicate side effects happen after you call the function. We also use the log as a closure variable. He's harmless though, so this is ok. For now. See Part 9: Logging & Purity to see a counterpoint to this.\nconst Ain't So Constant\nThe const, or constant, is not a panacea to immutability. While we can define complex objects like Arrays and Objects using const:\nconst friends = ['üêÑ', 'üêï']\n\nIf we then try to re-assign it, anywhere:\nfriends = ['ü¶Ü']\nTypeError: Assignment to constant variable.\n\nWe get an error. However, there are other ways around this:\nfriends.push('ü¶Ü ')\nconsole.log(friends) // [ 'üêÑ', 'üêï', 'ü¶Ü' ]\n\nPure const\nSolution: Use immutable return values, assign those to const.\nComplex objects like Object and Array, or even modules and class instances will have methods that can hide mutation; changing a variable's value. Practice immutability by creating new objects, deep clones, or using Destructuring assignment shown in Same Input, Same Output, No Side Effects inside of pure functions.\nOur example above can be changed to pure by using Array destructuring:\nconst addFriends = (friends, newFriend) => ([...friends, newFriend])\n\nNow, we can add all kinds of friends, multiple times, and it's a pure function, and doesn't really care if const works like one would assume a constant should work or not:\nconst friends = ['üêÑ', 'üêï']\nconst newFriends = addFriends(friends, 'ü¶Ü')\nconsole.log(friends) // [ 'üêÑ', 'üêï' ]\nconsole.log(newFriends) // [ 'üêÑ', 'üêï', 'ü¶Ü' ]\nconst newFriendsAgain = addFriends(friends, 'ü¶Ü')\nconsole.log(friends) // [ 'üêÑ', 'üêï' ]\nconsole.log(newFriends) // [ 'üêÑ', 'üêï', 'ü¶Ü' ]\nconsole.log(newFriendsAgain) // [ 'üêÑ', 'üêï', 'ü¶Ü' ]\n\nConclusions\nUsing let and const is fine as long as your function follows the pure function rules of same input, same output, no side effects. Using closure variables and functions, however, is dangerous. As you saw above, console.log is ok because he's a noop, but most aren't. For closure variables, most are by ref, if they don't come in by your function arguments and affect the output, your function will break the rules and not be pure. Making copies won't work because sometimes closures won't be there causing a null pointer error. As long as you contain the mutations within the life of your function, it's pure, and using var, let, and const is fine.\n"},"part1/using_vs_enforcing_immutability.html":{"url":"part1/using_vs_enforcing_immutability.html","title":"Using vs. Enforcing Immutability","keywords":"","body":"Using vs Enforcing Immutability\nIn The Case for var and let, we showed Array destructuring as a way to support immutability instead of relaying on const to ensure you cannot modify an Array. There is a subtle, but important, attitude there not be missed. We want to encourage a normal way of returning immutable data instead of enforcing immutable data.\nEnforcing immutable data would be using things like Object.freeze, the Immutable.js library, or heavy handed clone methods such as:\nconst clone = object => JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(object))\n\nThis is not what Functional Programming is about. It's about using and composing pure functions, not ensuring someone cannot mutate data. If you use pure functions and compose them, you end up not mutating data, and thus there is no reason to enforce it.\n... however, in the real world, you will be working with non-FP programmers, writing non-FP code, using non-FP libraries. Sometimes knowing how to suss out the mutation, prevent it, or benefit from performance techniques are helpful to support immutability.\nFor atomics like String, Boolean, and Number, they are copied by value, and are easy to clone; by making a new variable/constant or function return value, they give you a new clone.\nFor Arrays and Objects, however, favor Destructuring Assignment in JavaScript. Python and Lua are more complicated.\nObject.freeze\nFrameworks like Redux ensure there is only 1 variable in your application. You never mutate the data yourself, instead asking the store to hide the access, and provide functions that allow the data to be changed internally using pure functions.\nIf you're dealing with a legacy system, or with code not written in using pure functions, using Object.freeze can help probe where the mutation is ocurring in a heavy handed way by triggering an exception wherever the mutation exists. Functional Programming is about returning values, not causing side effects, and throwing errors is just that: intentional side effects.\nHowever, it can be a powerful tool to help find the impurity, fix it, and move forward.\nFirst, ensure your code is in strict mode, typically writing \"use strict\" at the top of the file(s). Second, wrap your data in Object.freeze:\nObject.freeze(myObjectOrArray)\n\nAnytime code attempts to modify it, it'll throw a TypeError, and you should be able to glean where the offending non-FP code is from the stack trace.\nThe bad news is, if you leave this code in your program, you're intentionally leaving a side effect (code that can throw an error) in your coe. Once you've found the offending mutation, you should remove it if you wish to be pure.\nThe good news is, if you don't, as long as you don't have any mutation, it'll work just fine with Object destructuring.\nImmutable.js\nThe Immutable.js library allows you to use common data types, but in an immutable way. For exampe, Array and Object in JavaScript can easily be used in immutable ways by using Object/Array Destructuring Assignment, but things like Map and Set cannot. Also, only some methods of Array are immutable. Immutable gives you all these data types with methods that are pure, and the data is immutable. They've also added many performance enhancements beyond just memoize (caching) that you may benefit from.\nTo be clear, you do not need Immutable to write pure functions with immutable data in JavaScript. However, their API is nice, having extra data types is helpful, and gleaning some of the performance benefits is massive icing. For some, having the enforced immutability gives them confidence in their code.\n"},"part1/spot_the_impurities.html":{"url":"part1/spot_the_impurities.html","title":"Spot The Impurities","keywords":"","body":"Spot The Impurities\nWe're going to show a series of functions that are pure and impure. You'll see the various ways they break the pure function rules, and how to fix them. The strength of dynamic languages is that they have a wide variety of developers from different backgrounds such as Imperative, Object Oriented, and Declarative (Functional Programming).\nDeclarative is in the minority.\nAs such, you'll be navigating a lot of impure code and will have to decide what to make pure and what not too based on your experience, deadlines, and team norms. Knowing the nuanced ways one can break function purity will help you navigate non-pure code. You'll also start to develop a Spidey Sense about the signs of impurity, both in the code you read and in the code you write. As you develop this 6th sense, it'll help you on your journey to function purity and in code reviews of peers.\nPrior Art\nBut first, let's look at the various pure and impure functions built into JavaScript itself.\nMath.round(1.034) // 1\nMath.round(1.034) // 1\nMath.round(1.034) // 1\n\nSame input, same output. There is no side effects, either; you're just operating on the Number you passed in. Since the Number you passed is pass \"by val\", it'll create a clone, so the output is a completely different Number than the one you passed in.\nHowever, even Math can be impure:\nMath.random() // 0.9746597969597086\nMath.random() // 0.58324610344788\nMath.random() // 0.8089727088931593\n\nSame input, different output. Now cryptologists, those who work in software security, will tell you that technically Math.random() isn't random and thus deterministic. While true, the function still breaks function purity rules.\nArrays, which are passed \"by ref\", different variable pointing to the same data, also have their share of pure and impure functions.\nIf we want to combine 2 Arrays together we can use concat:\nconst parents = [ 'Jesse', 'Brandy' ]\nconst kids = [ 'Sydney', 'Rowan' ]\nconst family = parents.concat(kids)\nconsole.log(family) // [ 'Jesse', 'Brandy', 'Sydney', 'Rowan' ]\nconsole.log(parents) // [ 'Jesse', 'Brandy' ]\nconsole.log(kids) // [ 'Sydney', 'Rowan' ]\n\nSame input, same output, no side effects.\nHowever, reverse doesn't create a new Array, and instead mutates the original.\nconsole.log(parents) // [ 'Jesse', 'Brandy' ]\nconst reversed = parents.reverse()\nconsole.log(reversed) // [ 'Brandy', 'Jesse' ]\nconsole.log(parents) // [ 'Brandy', 'Jesse' ]\n\nSame input, same output, but it has side effects. The world changes after it runs because it doesn't utilize immutability.\nLibraries like Ramda are built using pure functions. This makes it so you can use the same method names like Array's reverse, but not worry about side effects as all return values are immutable.\nClosures\nClosures, whether Node or Browser, are a common way to utilizes imported modules and classes.\nimport request from 'request-promise'\n\nconst getUsers = () => {\n    return request.get('/api/users/all', {json: true})\n}\n\nThis breaks the pure function rules in 2 ways: it's affected by the outside world, and it has side effects after it runs. The getUsers won't always return the same output because the request doesn't come in from the function arguments. You'll also end up having to mutate your code using mocking/stubbing libraries like Sinon or TestDouble to test it. The side effects is from the request.get making an HTTP call.\nPartial Solution: Declare your dependencies in your arguments.\nYou make it pure by passing in the request module.\nimport request from 'request-promise'\n\nconst getUsers = request => {\n    return request.get('/api/users/all', {json: true})\n}\n\nWhile you could turn your internet off, and the Promise that the request returns fails, the getUsers function is still returning a Promise every time from the same module. To unit test it, all you need is a simple stub:\nconst requestStub = { get: (url, options) => Promise.resolve(['user'])}\nit('should return a Promise', ()=> {\n    const result = getUsers(requestStub)\n    const isAPromise = isPromise(result)\n    expect(isAPromise).to.equal(true)\n})\n// using chai-as-promised\nit('should resolve with a good stub', ()=> {\n    return expect(getUsers(requestStub)).to.be.fulfilled\n})\nit('should resolve with a user', ()=> {\n    return expect(getUsers(requestStub)).to.become(['user'])\n})\n\nHTTP Call Fix?\nFixing the HTTP call that is made, affecting the outside world after the function runs, is beyond the scope of this book. That level of purity is only gained through creating your own class/Object to contain those side effects, like Elm does, or using strict state containers like Redux, Calmm, or even more advanced methods. Many think it isn't worth it given it's such a common thing to do in browser applications and Node API's.\nIn JavaScript, the simple solution is to return a Promise. It'll resolve when the operation is successful or not through .then and .catch. As long as the function you send to the Promise is a pure function, you're good \"enough\".\nReact Components\n// TODO\n"},"part1/error_quest.html":{"url":"part1/error_quest.html","title":"Error Quest!","keywords":"","body":"Hold Up, Wait a Minute, Please Don't Put Some BOOM In It\nReturning Errors from functions is supported and encouraged in Functional Programming, but throwing them is not. Throwing errors via throw new Error('boom') breaks the first rule of pure functions, same input, same output because there is no output. Sometimes, an Error can cause unintended side effects in a piece of code, and breaks the \"same output\" part of the rule. Finally, once you throw an Error, the world is affected after the function ran, thus breaking the second rule of no side effects.\nFor Node applications, this can cause a pm2 to restart one of your Node processes, a  Docker container to be destroyed in your ECS cluster or all kinds of infrastructure to be recycled based on error logs. Those are quite a lot of side effects from a simple throw.\nThe bad news is, you're always going to have errors. Functional Programming won't fix your internet being down when you're making a REST call.\nThe good news is when Errors occur in FP code, they won't break your program. For UI code, you can design for these errors predictably. If you're willing to create total functions, it'll tell you exactly what went wrong without you having to make sense of a long strack trace.\nStandard Error Handling\nLet's take our existing bullet-proof, never fail function:\nconst alwaysTrue = () => true\n\nAnd unit test it:\nconst result = alwaysTrue()\nexpect(result).to.equal(true)\n\nNow let's create one that always booms:\nconst alwaysBoom = () => { throw new Error('boom') }\n\nAnd unit test it a similar way:\nconst result = alwaysBoom()\nexpect(result).to.equal(true)\n\nInstead of the expect line running, it explodes with Error: boom. It breaks the same input, same output rule because there is no output. To be more explicit about that, let's wrap in a try catch:\nlet result\ntry {\n    result = alwaysBoom()\n} catch (error) {\n    console.log(\"error:\", error)\n}\nconsole.log(\"result:\", result)\nexpect(result).to.equal(true)\n\nIt'll print out your error, and then result: undefined. That's because it never returned a value, went straight to the catch.\nReturn The Error\nSolution: Return the Error.\nWhen a function has a problem, instead of throwing an Error, return the Error. Think about functions that could throw errors. Suddenly, they can have 2 possible return values, just like a Promise can either fulfill in the then or fail in the catch. It worked, and here's your data, or it failed, and here is why.\nconst safeParseJSON = string => {\n    try {\n        const result = JSON.parse(string)\n        return thingsWorked\n    } catch(error) {\n        return thingsFailed\n    }\n}\n\n... but what should we return to signal things worked or failed? Is undefined and the JSON Object good enough? That makes it a bit hard to work with on the caller side. What does undefined mean; it worked, or the JSON string was bad?\nLet's see how other languages handle this in a slightly functional way.\nGo Error Handling\nThis is a common pattern solved in other languages. In Go, it's built INTO the language. In Go, you can return multiple values. This has made it a convention to return errors as the last argument, and check them in a procedural style before continuing. \nfunc safeParseJSON(jsonString string) (object, error) {\n    defer func() {\n        if r := recover(); r != nil {\n            fmt.Println(\"couldn't parse JSON and it panicked\", r)\n            return nil, errors.New(\"jsonString\")\n        }\n    }()\n    parsed, err := json.Marshal(jsonString)\n    return parsed, err\n}\n\nobj, err := safeParseJSON(\"{\\\"foo\\\":\\\"bar\\\"}\")\nif err != nil {\n    fmt.Printf(\"couldn't parse JSON: %v\\n\", err)\n    return\n}\nfmt.Println(\"Parsed JSON:\", obj)\n\nHowever, it's still written in a procedural style, hence Rebecca Skinner creating Gofpher for Monadic Error Handling in Go (i.e. JavaScript Promise style). Note the verbose defer to recover from panics. \nLua Error Handling\nLua has multiple return values for functions as well, and provides a function called pcall, short for \"protected call\" that works similarly. Unlike Go, the first value is \"did this function work or not\". Also, if Go uses panic, the entire error blows away the stack, and you get no return value, forcing you to use a defer. In Lua, the p stands for \"protected\", effectively a try/catch. If the function failed via an Exception, the 2nd return value will be the error, else whatever value(s) the function returns. So Lua's pcall is pretty powerful compared to Go.\nlocal success, errorOrObject = pcall(JSON.parse, string)\nif success == false then\n    print(\"Failed:\", errorOrObject)\n    return\nend\nprint(\"Parsed JSON:\", errorOrObject)\n\nThe downside here is the errorOrObject is either the error, or your value. It's not very explicit or clear; you have to look at the success first to know which it is.\nPython Error Handling\nPython supports multiple return values through Tuples, an immutable Array, that you can then easily unpack into return values.\ndef safe_json_parse(string):\n    try:\n        result = JSON.parse(string)\n        return (True, None, result)\n    except Exception as e:\n        return (False, str(e), None)\n\nsuccess, error, obj = safe_json_parse(string)\nif success == False:\n    print(\"Failed:\", error)\n    return\nprint(\"Parsed JSON:\", obj)\n\nThe Simple Object\nAs you can see, 3 other languages support returning multiple values from a function to determine if that function worked, and if not, what went wrong. JavaScript does not support multiple values, but there are multiple ways to provide the same style of error handling.\nThe first way is just to return an Object, then destructure the values. Let's update our original safeParseJSON function:\nconst safeParseJSON = string => {\n    try {\n        const result = JSON.parse(string)\n        return { ok: true, data: result }\n    } catch(error) {\n        return { ok: false, error }\n    }\n}\n\nIf it works, say ok is true, and return the data. If it fails, say ok is false, and return the error.\nconst { ok, error, data } = safeParseJSON(`{\"foo\":\"bar\"}`)\nif(ok === false) {\n    console.log(\"Failed:\", error)\n    return\n}\nconsole.log(\"Parsed JSON:\", data)\n\nAsync Simple Object: sureThing\nIf you're dealing with asynchronous errors, and you want the same syntax, whip out the async/await syntax. This also has the nice addition of ensuring you never have to use try/catch with async/await again. You don't even need to use the catch ever again if you don't want to. It's called a sureThing, a Promise that always succeeds, created by my co-worker Jason Kaiser.\nFirst have your Promise resolve with the same Object structure:\nconst safeReadFile = fileName =>\n    new Promise( success =>\n        fs.readFile(fileName, (error, data) =>\n            error\n            ? success({ ok: false, error })\n            : success({ ok: true, data })\n        )\n    )\n\nThen use it the same with, just with await:\nconst example = async () => {\n    let { ok, error, data } = await safeReadFile(`config.json`)\n    if(ok === false) {\n        console.log(\"Failed:\", error)\n        return\n    }\n    console.log(\"File contents:\", data)\n    ( { ok, error, data } = safeParseJSON(data) )\n    if(ok === false) {\n        console.log(\"Failed to parse JSON:\", error)\n        return\n    }\n    console.log(\"Parsed JSON:\", data)\n}\n\nContrast the above with typical async/await syntax that doesn't return this type of Object:\nconst example = async () => {\n    let configString\n    try {\n        configString = await safeReadFile(`config.txt`)\n        console.log(\"File contents:\", configString)\n    } catch (configError) {\n        console.log(\"Failed:\", configError)\n        return\n    }\n\n    let json\n    try {\n        json = safeParseJSON(configString)\n        console.log(\"Parsed JSON:\", json)\n    } catch(parseError) {\n        console.log(\"Failed to parse:\", parseError)\n    }\n}\n\nIf you're ok with using normal Promise chaining, that works too:\nconst example = () =>\n    safeReadFile(`config.json`)\n    .then( ({ok, error, data}) =>\n        ok\n        ? safeParseJSON(data)\n        : error)\n    .then( ({ok, error, data}) =>\n        ok\n        ? data\n        : error\n    )\n    .then(json => console.log(\"Parsed JSON:\", json))\n    .catch(error => console.log(\"Read or parse error:\", error))\n\nPure Object\nNow that you get the basics around returning if a function failed or not using an Object, let's make it more pure. First, the safeParseJSON does not declare it's global dependencies, so we need to fix that:\nconst safeParseJSON = (JSON, string) => {\n    try {\n        const result = JSON.parse(string)\n        return { ok: true, data: result }\n    } catch(error) {\n        return { ok: false, error }\n    }\n}\n\nAs explained later in the Working With OOP section, we take the whole JSON object vs. just it's parse function as the first parameter, and the string second. You'll see this pattern of \"known things to the left, dynamic things to the right\" a lot and should do it yourself as well.\nNow for purifying safeReadFile, declaring his dependency on the fs file system module:\nconst safeReadFile = (fs, fileName) =>\n    new Promise((success, failure) =>\n        fs.readFile(fileName, (error, data) =>\n            error\n            ? failure({ ok: false, error })\n            : success({ ok: true, data })\n        )\n    )\n\nAnd putting it all together again:\nconst example = (JSON, fs) =>\n    safeReadFile(fs, `config.json`)\n    .then( ({ok, error, data}) =>\n        ok\n        ? safeParseJSON(JSON, data)\n        : error)\n    .then( ({ok, error, data}) =>\n        ok\n        ? data\n        : error\n    )\n    .then(json => console.log(\"Parsed JSON:\", json))\n    .catch(error => console.log(\"Read or parse error:\", error))\n\nA Bunch of Things Could Go Wrong\nThe above lumps all errors into the catch as a String. We have to search in 1 place without any ability to be proactive or reactive. Sometimes we need to know what error occurred as either some are ok, or some require different code paths for us to take. We'll cover this advanced error handling in the \"Result\" section in Part 5 and being more clear about what exact error it was in \"Union\" in Part 6.\n"},"part1/not_allowed.html":{"url":"part1/not_allowed.html","title":"What's Not Allowed","keywords":"","body":"The Specialist\nGiven how pure functions work, many of languages existing tools are off limits. They differ from language to language, such as how Lua handles Object scope compared to JavaScript for example, but what they all have in common is violating pure function rules. Thus, they are off limits if you wish to remain pure.\nHow pure you wish to be is up to you and your team. Pragmatism and deadlines can overrule the list below.\nWe'll cover each in turn, and offer suggestions on how you can you use some of them safely if possible.\nFunction Declarations & Function Expressions\nA function declaration has a bunch of legacy functionality that can break purity rules.\nThe this keyword\nSynopsis: This is a built-in mutation. Stay far away.\nThe this keyword is the cornerstone of how JavaScript supports encapsulating Objects as well as providing support for Object Oriented programming through classes. It also is one of the most common cause of bugs, and responsible for a large amount of text on the internet explaining how scope and this works.\nSince this can change based on how the function is invoked:\n// function declaration\nfunction Cow(name) {\n    this.name = name\n}\n// function expression\nCow.prototype.getName = function() { console.log(this.name) }\n\na = new Cow('a')\nconsole.log(a.name) // a\nconsole.log(a.getName()) // a\nb = Cow() // throws Error\nc = new (Cow.bind())\nconsole.log(c.getName()) // throws Error\n\nThere a bunch of different versions of these, depending upon if you use Object.create or the new keyword vs. not, the class keyword, attaching to the prototype vs. emulating static vs. using the static keyword, using various Babel plugins to fix, etc. On and on.\narguments\nSynopsis: Dangerous in closures, but typically only used in edge cases, so as long as you avoid closures, you'll be ok. We recommend you stick to functions that take a specific number of arguments. Sadly, arguments is only with function declarations so we recommend you avoid.\nPure functions can work with variadic functions; functions that take an arbitrary number of arguments. This can be hard to get right so ensure extra unit tests here. The arguments keyword, unlike this, CAN be depended upon, but can subtly change in the values it has once you start bringing closures.\nfunction add() {\n    let sum = 0\n    for(let i = 0; i\nnew.target\nSynopsis: Implies you're ok with this and throwing exceptions. Don't use.\nsuper\nSynopsis: Like this, avoid.\nThe super keyword is for inheritance in Object Oriented Programming. Like this it is rife with breaking at various times. In dynamic languages, part of the power is affecting, at runtime, class/Object polymorphism. This power, however, can ensure pure functions have completely different outputs or errors without the function's inputs changing, thus changing the outputs, or having unforseen side effects from super-class implementations. Like this, avoid.\nFor front-end frameworks which utilize classes to encapsulate Graphical User Interface (GUI) state (i.e. pixels), it is unavoidable. There is a long history of using Object Oriented Programming for UI's. React extends a Component class but encourages you to use Composition over Inheritance. Angular does the same using class decorators but thankfully often employs interfaces and compiler smarts. Pixi.js uses a Sprite class to abstract away Canvas pixels.\nUI development in general commonly has a lot of side-effects, so do your best to keep most of your work in pure functions.\nDefault Arguments\nSynopsis: Dangerous in closures like arguments, and breaks function currying. Should be avoided, unless single argument only for by val types (i.e. String, Number, etc) which provide pseudo immutability. Use single argument functions carefully.\nSolution: Favor partial applications over default arguments.\nLike variadic functions, functions which have an arbitrary amount of arguments, default arguments have the same challenges. You can create pure functions using them, but unfortunately they break function currying. Most function currying is based around a specific number of arguments, called Arity, for a function, and creates confusing behavior when you get a function's result back when you were expecting a partial application instead. It is better to favor explicit arguments and then make a partial application for those developers who don't know what to pass or just want to pass less arguments.\nAs you'll learn later, functions with default arguments are harder to compose because you'll get unintended arguments. When you're explicit with partial applications, it's more clear what argument goes where and the functions can be wired together more easily and predictably.\nClasses\nSynopsis The class keyword should be avoided for the same reasons as using this. Classes are also a lot more difficult to compose.\nThe whole concept of storing variables as member and static variables inside a class, internal mutable state, causes a lot of side effects. It also ensures you won't get the same output with the same input. Class methods often have no input as they'll handle the inputs by referencing internal data on this. They typically don't have outputs either because they are modifying or updating state internally on this. As classes start using Inheritance or Composition, they'll be creating even more mutable state internally as they grow in size. Finally, JavaScript's implementation is not immutable, and both this, and the class itself, can be modified at runtime leading to various unintended null pointers. These errors or different outputs are not pure.\nLike default arguments, classes are a lot harder to compose with.\nSee Dealing with OOP for strategies on using as safely as possible as at the time of this writing, encountering OOP in code bases you work on is unavoidable.\nthrow\nSynopsis: Do not use throw. Instead, return the Error in an Object or an Algebraic Data Type that describes what we wrong, similar to Lua's pcall or Lua and Go's ability to return multiple return values.\nErrors are a challenging side effect. Not only do they prevent return values from even working, but occasionally, they can create situations where data, or the application itself, is in an unknown state vs crashing outright. This breaks the same output rule as well as the side effects rule.\nThrowing Errors is supposed to enable developers to read the stack trace to glean where the application broke. Not all stack traces are created equal, nor are they easy to quickly deduce what went wrong. JavaScript is notorious for having source maps that do not map to the source giving red herrings on top of badly written error messages which are red herrings. In imperative style code, you can \"find the line where things went wrong\". In debugging functional code, you're interested in \"why did the function return an error instead of a success\". In composed functions and programs, you're interested in \"where in this pipeline of functions did my data become wrong\". You use imperative style logs, composed helper functions, or even breakpoints in a step debugger for those situations, not stack traces. We never want to intentionally break or crash an application.\nThe exception is in Erlang/Elixir or Akka in Scala/Java where \"let it crash\" is the norm. You're more interested in application uptime than purity in those cases. For JavaScript, the equivalent is using pm2 or Docker on ECS and any uncaught sync or async error means your application is in an unknonwn state, possibly impure, so you just nuke the entire process/container and get a new one. Since your application is supposedly stateless and uses immutable data, there is no worry about \"losing\" information as something like Redis or your Database handles being the single source of truth and state.\nServerless is the same way. While it might be tempting to throw since the function will only run for a few milliseconds/seconds anyway on disposable infrastructure, errors should be what they mean: your code is broken, you or your team needs to fix it. See Part 6 on Algebraic Data Types for better return values for errors.\n"},"part1/practice_purity.html":{"url":"part1/practice_purity.html","title":"Practice Purity with Predicates","keywords":"","body":"Practice Purity Through Predicates\nThe simplest way to learn how to create pure functions without worrying about the side effects part is creating predicates. Predicates are pure functions that only return true or false.\nalwaysTrue and alwaysFalse\nYou can do it the old school way:\nfunction alwaysTrue() {\n    return true\n}\n\nor the new school, whatever is comfortable for you:\nconst alwaysTrue = () => true\n\nFor false, it's the same:\nconst alwaysFalse = () => false\n\nThese functions will never fail. Unit testing them requires no fixtures or stubs. You can do it the imperative way so you can later console.log steps and parts that aren't making sense:\nconst result = alwaysTrue()\nexpect(result).to.equal(true)\n\nOr just go for it inline since \"they never fail\":\nexpect(alwaysTrue()).to.equal(true)\n\nRuntime Type Checkers\nDynamic languages often don't have good, if any, runtime type validation. That's part of the allure of them, not to be burdened with types if you want to quickly play with ideas or ship software.\nSometimes, though, you need to know if something is of a certain type. Some languages provide functions for this, like type in Python and Lua. For JavaScript, it varies, but a lot are built upon the typeof operator. These can get quite nuanced, so don't worry if yours aren't exact, were more concerned with you feeling comfortable not doing math equations in functions, and instead creating pure functions you'd actually use in your day to day work.\nFor example, if a user is logging into a website, you'll probably do form validation on the client to verify that the user hasn't entered blank text. On the server, you'll do the same check as well to verify the client sent you a username that has at least some text in it, else you'll send back a custom error letting them know what went wrong.\nFirst we have to know what a string is:\nconst isString = o => typeof o === 'string'\n\nLet's test her out:\nisString('cow') // true\nisString(1) // false\nisString(true) // false\nisString(new Date()) // false\nisString([]) // false\nisString({}) // false\n\nCool, so far so good. Now let's create a predicate that uses our isString predicate to check if the String is a valid one. The \"legit\" is slang for \"legitimate\".\nconst legitString = o => isString(o) && o.length > 0\n\nYou could just instead write:\nconst legitString = o => o.length > 0\n\nBut then that would throw an Error if you gave it null or undefined by accident:\nlegitString(undefined) // TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined\n\nAnd gives you possibly strange results with Arrays:\nlegitString([]) // false\nlegitString(['a']) // true... whaaaaa\n\nWe need to be specific that we're talking about Strings, but notice no need for composition, using an && and or || or is fine.\n"},"part1/practice_stubs.html":{"url":"part1/practice_stubs.html","title":"Practice Purity with Test Stubs","keywords":"","body":""},"part2/":{"url":"part2/","title":"Part 2: Getting and Setting Data","keywords":"","body":"Getting and Setting Data\nA lot of functional programming revolves around functions.

For objects you know the shape of, meaning you know what properties and value types they typically have, you can create these yourself.\nconst getFirstName = person => {\n    if(person) {\n        return person.firstName\n    }\n    return undefined\n}\n\nThen you can test it to verify it's safe:\nexpect(getFirstName(person)).to.equal('Jesse')\nexpect(getFirstName(undefined)).to.equal(undefined)\n\nThis is such a common thing to do that Lodash has a get function, Ramda and Sanctuary have prop.\nimport { get } from 'lodash'\n\nconsole.log(get(person, 'firstName')) // Jesse\nconsole.log(get(person, 'fistName')) // undefined\nconsole.log(get(undefined, 'firstName')) // undefined\n\nDem Deep Gets\nDeeply nested properties, however, require null or null operators:\nconst getStreetAddress = person => {\n    if(person && person.address && person.address.home) {\n        return person.address.home.street\n    }\n    return undefined\n}\n\nIt's less code and safer just to use get with the path:\nconst getStreetAddress = person => get(person, 'person.address.home.street')\n\nNow those are just Objects. Arrays require you to do runtime type checking:\nconst getFirstHomePhone = person => {\n    if(\n        person \n        && person.address \n        && person.address.home \n        && Array.isArray(person.address.home.phone)\n        ) {\n        return person.address.home.phone[0]\n    }\n    return undefined\n}\n\n... or you could just use get:\nconst getFirstHomePhone = person => get(person, 'person.address.home.phone[0]')\n\nThis also works great for deeply nested JSON data structures you often get back from REST API's as well as SOAP and XML you've parsed to JSON.\nDefault Values\nYou'll often configure your Node API using the config library. One thing you'll run into when configuring for different development environments like dev, qa, and prod is default values in case the configuration intentionally doesn't exist. In the browser, if you run into configuration erorrs, you just fall back to the defaults so the application still works. \nYou can do that using get or Ramda's propOr:\nconst url = get(configuration, 'services.emailURL', 'http://dev.server.com/email')\n\nIf it can't find the services.emailURL path on configuration, or if configuration is undefined, it'll just default to that dev url, 'http://dev.server.com/email'.\n"},"part2/set.html":{"url":"part2/set.html","title":"Set","keywords":"","body":"Mutating Data\nKnowing the problems with dots and assuming you've avoided them, if you've read the Part 1, you know what's wrong with this code:\nperson.firstName = 'Cow'\n\nThat isn't a function. It mutates data instead of using immutable data. It affects the outside world by modifying an Object vs. copying it. You no longer set data that way. You CAN set it like that inside pure functions, though.\nSet\nNow that you know how to get data, setting is very similar. To update the firstName, you can write your own pure setter:\nconst setFirstName = (person, newFirstName) => {\n    return {...person, firstName: newFirstName}\n}\n\nAnd if you manually test it to ensure it's pure:\nconsole.log(person.firstName) // Jesse\nsetFirstName(person, 'Cow').firstName // Cow\nconsole.log(person.firstName) // Jesse\n\nBut same problem as before with deeply nested properties. For that, use Lodash' set:\nconst setFirstPhoneNumber = (person, newPhoneNumber) => {\n    return set(person, 'address.home.phone[0]', newPhoneNumber)\n}\n\nPure. Immutable data. Same input, same output, and no side effects.\n"},"part2/lenses.html":{"url":"part2/lenses.html","title":"Lenses","keywords":"","body":"Optic Basics: Lenses\nTo use get and set together, Ramda use lenses. They are a bit lower-level and more specific API's. Lodash handles both Arrays and Objects, whereas you need to do that with separate functions in Ramda. Lenses combine get and set style functionality to navigate and modify large structures by composing smaller functions together.\nIf you hear the word \"Optics\", that's what a lot of the Functional people use to refer to lens functionality.\nFocus on a Property or Path, and View It in Ramda\nJust like there are 2 functions to get a property and get a deeply nested property, so too are there 2 lenses to do the same. Unlike Ramda's prop and path (Lodash get does what they both do), functions that return values, a lense is a Type. You call it like any other function to return a configured lens. We'll create some lenses, then use them to \"focus\" on certain properties and paths of our person Object.\nTo focus a lens on the name property, we need to create a prop lens via lensProp:\nimport { lensProp } from 'ramda'\n\nconst person = {\n  name: 'Jesse Warden', \n  address: { \n      street: '123 Cow Ville', \n      phone: ['123-456-7890']\n  }\n}\nconst nameLens = lensProp('name')\n\nJust like Ramda's prop or Lodash' get, we can see what that lens reveals by passing it to view:\nimport { ..., lensProp, view } from 'ramda'\n...\nconsole.log(view(nameLens, person)) // Jesse Warden\n\nFor the street, we'll need a path lens via lensPath, and pass that to view as well:\nimport { ..., lensPath } from 'ramda'\n...\nconst streetLens = lensPath(['address', 'street'])\nconsole.log(view(streetLens, person)) // 123 Cow Ville\n\nSet With Lenses\nUsing our name lens, let's set the name via Ramda's set:\nimport { ..., set } from 'ramda'\n\nconst result = set(nameLens, 'Cow', person)\nconsole.log(result.name) // Cow\nconsole.log(person.name) // Jesse Warden\n\nCool, just like Lodash' set!\nUsing the street lens should yield a similar result:\nconst result = set(streetLens, '21 Jump Street', person)\nconsole.log(result.address.street) // 21 Jump Street\nconsole.log(person.address.street) // 123 Cow Ville\n\nModification With Lenses\nNow that we know how to view our data with our lenses, and use them to set things they're focused on, let's use them to modify data we're focused on in an immutable way using pure functions. Instead of \"set it to this new value\", we'll instead \"take the value that's there, put it into this function, and whatever comes out, set the new value to that result\". Below will use our lense to run a function on the property and replace it with the value that function returns. It'll then give us a cloned Object back with the modification:\nimport { ..., over, toLower } from 'ramda'\n\nconst result = over(nameLens, toLower, person)\nconsole.log(result.name) // jesse warden\nconsole.log(person.name) // Jesse Warden\n\nIn Lodash, the set will modify it with the value you give it. The over in this case will replace it with with whatever function you give it taking the current value as an input, and the output as the new value. Note that it's assumed the function you give it, in this case toLower, is a pure function.\n// TODO: Do I take this out? Move to another section? Seems advanced with composition way too early.\nComposition With Lenses\n// TODO: I hate this entire section.\nUsing our above example, we can combine it with other functions to iterate through Arrays of Objects in a pure way. We'll take a list of people:\nconst people = [\n  {\n    name: 'jesse warden', \n    address: { \n        street: '123 Cow Ville', \n        phone: ['1235551234']\n    }\n  }\n  , {\n    name: 'brandy fortune', \n    address: { \n        street: '123 Cow Ville', \n        phone: ['1235555678']\n    }\n  }\n  , {\n    name: 'marge paradis', \n    address: { \n        street: '789 Farm Road', \n        phone: ['5675550987']\n    }\n  }\n]\n\nA function to clean up their name to 2 separate properties of firstName and lastName and remove the name property. We'll use a simple prop, much like a Lodash get: \nimport { ..., prop } from 'ramda'\n\nconst getPersonNameToFirstAndLastName = person => {\n  const firstName = prop('name', person).split(' ')[0]\n  const lastName = prop('name', person).split(' ')[1]\n  return {\n    ...person,\n    name: undefined,\n    firstName,\n    lastName\n  }\n}\nconsole.log(getPersonNameToFirstAndLastName(people[0]))\n{ name: undefined,\n  address: { street: '123 Cow Ville', phone: [ '1235551234' ] },\n  firstName: 'jesse',\n  lastName: 'warden' }\n\nWe'll also format the phone number to be a more useful data type and use Ramda's path, like a Lodash get, but requires each path item be an item in an Array:\nimport { ..., path } from 'ramda'\n\nconst fixPhoneNumber = person => {\n  const string = path(['address', 'phone', '0'], person) \n  const areaCode = parseInt(string.substring(0, 3))\n  return {\n    ...person,\n    phone: {\n      formatted: `(${areaCode}) ${string.substring(3, 6)}-${string.substring(6, 10)}`,\n      areaCode,\n    }\n    , address: undefined\n  } \n}\nconsole.log(people[2])\n{ name: 'marge paradis',\n  address: undefined,\n  phone: { formatted: '(567) 555-0987', areaCode: 567 } }\n\nWe'll also fix the case of the names using Lodash' upperFirst, which will change \"jesse\" into \"Jesse\", inside a Ramda lensProp, which is like prop, but is used in lens functions:\nimport { ..., over, lensProp } from 'ramda'\nimport { upperFirst } from 'lodash'\n\nconst firstNameLens = lensProp('firstName')\nconst lastNameLens = lensProp('lastName')\n\nconst upperFirstName = person => over(firstNameLens, upperFirst, person)\nconst upperLastName = person => over(lastNameLens, upperFirst, person)\n\nUsing our above code we'll compose them together (we're using pipe below, I like it because it's left to right, whereas compose is right to left). Our person will go in the first function, getPersonNameToFirstAndLastName, and whatever comes out will be fed to fixPhoneNumber, and whatever comes out will be fed to upperFirstName, and whatever comes out will be fed to upperLastName, and whatever comes out will be your parsePerson return value. Similiar to a Promise .then chain, this one is synchronous.\nimport { pipe } from 'ramda'\n\nconst parsePerson = person =>\n  pipe(\n    getPersonNameToFirstAndLastName,\n    fixPhoneNumber,\n    upperFirstName,\n    upperLastName\n  )\n  (person)\n\nOne big ole pipe. Let's try it out on a single person:\nconsole.log(parsePerson(people[2]))\n{ name: undefined,\n  address: undefined,\n  firstName: 'Marge',\n  lastName: 'Paradis',\n  phone: { formatted: '(567) 555-0987', areaCode: 567 } }\n\nCool, now let's throw that in a map, and use on the entire Array of people:\nimport { ..., map } from 'ramda'\nconsole.log(\n  map(\n    parsePerson,\n    people\n  )\n)\n[ { name: undefined,\n    address: undefined,\n    firstName: 'Jesse',\n    lastName: 'Warden',\n    phone: { formatted: '(123) 555-1234', areaCode: 123 } },\n  { name: undefined,\n    address: undefined,\n    firstName: 'Brandy',\n    lastName: 'Fortune',\n    phone: { formatted: '(123) 555-5678', areaCode: 123 } },\n  { name: undefined,\n    address: undefined,\n    firstName: 'Marge',\n    lastName: 'Paradis',\n    phone: { formatted: '(567) 555-0987', areaCode: 567 } } ]\n\nAs you can see, for simple parsing, either a Lodash get or a Ramda prop and path can quickly focus on a single value, safely. Using lens functions, we can compose them together to iterate over a list of Objects in a pure way.\n// TOOD: remove undefined\n"},"part3/":{"url":"part3/","title":"Part 3: List Comprehensions","keywords":"","body":"List Comprehensions\nA list comprehension is a function that takes in an Array, and outputs a different Array. Whereas predicates are pure functions that return true or false, list comprehensions are very similar, with the goal to help reduce the amount of code required to write loops such as the for loop. The term popularized in Python, so if you're in JavaScript, you'd say \"Array Comprehensions\".\nPure loops with less code.\nMany people sell list comprehensions coming from the Ruby or Python background as a way to do loops with less code. That misses the fundamental goal is to ensure purity. You can create pure functions using regular for and while loops, just like you can use var and let, yet still ensure the function is pure. However, they are quite imperative, and you can make mistakes easier. It also has \"mutation mindset\" such as mutating a list index or keeping track of a current value, which is ok but isn't how pure functions work.\nIn true functional programming, there are no loops, only recursion. We don't care, though, because we'll just use the functions that take care of those details for us.\nThe Big 3\nIn weight lifting, there is the concept of The Big 3. The Squat, Bench Press, and Deadlift. They are the core exercises to become strong.\nList comprehensions are no different. The Big 3 for them is map, filter, and reduce. Here's a famous picture that helps visualize how they work using emoji üòÇ:\nmap([üêÆ, ü•î, üêî, üåΩ], cook)\n=== [üçî, üçü, üçó, üçø]\n\nfilter([üçî, üçü, üçó, üçø], isVegetarian)\n=== [üçü, üçø]\n\nreduce([üçî, üçü, üçó, üçø], eat)\n=== üí©\n\nWe'll cover them as well as using 3 additional functions they are used to build, every, some, and zip. Using these with predicates and other pure functions, you'll start to learn the basics of composing, and start to glimpse at how pure functions work well together in a more predictable fashion.\nFinally, you'll gain a re-appreciation for an old friend, the Array, and how powerful she is.\nNote on Browser / Node Support\nMany array comprehensions are being added to the core JavaScript Array class. That said, many will mutate the Array instead of returning a new Array. Even Lodash will occasionally do this. That said, for things like map, filter, etc. we'll be using Lodash merely because those particular functions are safe and immutable, and it's an extremely battle tested library. Additionally, the syntax for Lodash and Ramda is based on pure functions taking inputs whereas most Array methods are based on class methods which are subject to being impure because of them being defined on the mutable Array.prototype. Remember the Trouble With Dots. Modifying class prototypes has fallen out of fashion and is now a moderate security vulnerability. Most modern browsers including Node have good parity on ensuring map works the same in all browsers and engines. Thus you are welcome to use the native ones if you're so inclined.\nFor example, the map in Lodash only provides your function with the item in the Array. The native Array map however provides the item, the current index, and a reference to the original Array that is being iterated over. That index is very useful in some cases. Just be careful when you go theArray.map that theArray is actually undefined (see the Trouble With Array Access).\n"},"part3/map.html":{"url":"part3/map.html","title":"map","keywords":"","body":"map: 3 things go in, 3 new things come out\nThe map function is often used for parsing operations.

That means even if they are super simple, they're still expected to be strict about following the purity rules.\nThat means the arrayToPerson can be slightly improved to be more pure. If you read the Trouble with Array Bracket Access, then you understand that errors can occur in this function.\nThere is a pure function Lodash offers called nth and Ramda has as nth well that we can use to fix this.\nWhile accessing undefined using bracket access will throw an Error:\nundefined[3]\n// TypeError: Cannot read property '3' of undefined\n\nThe nth function just returns undefined:\nnth(undefined, 3)\n// undefined\n\nUsing that, we can make our map's conversion function:\nconst arrayToPerson = array =>\n    ({\n        name: array[0],\n        address: {\n            street: array[1],\n            phone: array[2]\n        },\n        type: array[3]\n    })\n\nInto a more pure version using nth:\nconst arrayToPerson = array =>\n    ({\n        name: nth(array, 0),\n        address: {\n            street: nth(array, 1),\n            phone: nth(array, 2),\n        },\n        type: nth(array, 3)\n    })\n\nConclusions\nMap: Take an Array of things in, give each thing to a function, store whatever that function gives you back in a new Array in the same position, then return that new Array back.

Notice while we're returning a new String each time, we ensure it's appended to the accumulator by injecting it in the front; whatever we add always goes at the end.\nWhat was summary in the for loop example is our 3rd argument to the reduce function.

The reduce function expects a pure reducer function, and is itself a pure function.\nUnlike map and filter, the reduce function can take long while to wrap your head around. Additionally, you can still struggle to remember exactly how it works for a long time, and continually look up the documentation on parameter order, and the reducer function parameter order. Also, the accumulator can be anything (a Number for adding numbers, another Array for doing a more complicated map, etc) so it can take time to find creative uses from your own exploration. Give yourself some slack; this is the hardest of The Big 3 list comprehensions to memorize, use, and get proficient with.\nFor those familiar with the Redux framework, the function reduce takes is called a reducer function, and that's basically the core of how Redux works. \n"},"part3/every.html":{"url":"part3/every.html","title":"every","keywords":"","body":"every: 3 things go in, true comes out if the predicate says all things are true\nThe every function takes an Array and a predicate function (a function that only returns true or false) and returns true if every item that's given to the predicate returns true, else false. It's a great example of an Array comprehension that is built upon map. It's used a lot in data validation.\nThink of every as asking \"Is everything true that _\". The blank is whatever your predicate function is figuring out to be true or not based on the input.\nOld Sk00l for\nLet's verify everyone in our party has full health or not.

In dynamic languages, since we don't have types, we may sometimes want to validate a piece of data we didn't make, say something coming from a parsed REST response or from reading a file.\nHere, we'll write some predicates to verify our new party member really is a party member, then we'll use every to ensure all are true. If even one fails and returns false, we want to know about it.\nThe predicates:\nimport { isString, isInteger, get } from 'lodash'\n\nconst hasLegitName = o =>\n    isString(get(o, 'name'))\n    && get(o, 'name').length > 0\n\nconst legitHitPoints = o =>\n    isInteger(o)\n    && o >= 0\n\nconst hasLegitHitPoints = o =>\n    legitHitPoints(get(o, 'hitPoints'))\n\nconst hasLegitMaxHitPoints = o =>\n    legitHitPoints(get(o, 'maxHitPoints'))\n\nNow we'll load them into every:\nconst legitPerson = o =>\n    every(\n        [\n            hasLegitName,\n            hasLegitHitPoints,\n            hasLegitHitPoints\n        ],\n        predicate => predicate(o)\n    )\n\nlegitPerson({\n    name: 'Rowan',\n    clazz: 'Bard',\n    hitPoints: 4,\n    maxHitPoints: 4\n}) // true\nlegitPerson({\n    name: 'Chicken Pot Pie'\n}) // false\n\nConclusions\nEvery: Take an Array of things as well as a predicate function, give every value to the predicate function, and if even one returns false, then every will return false, else return true.\n"},"part3/some.html":{"url":"part3/some.html","title":"some","keywords":"","body":"some: 3 things go in, true comes out if the predicate says at least one thing is true\nThe some functions an Array and a predicate function, and returns true if the predicate function returns true for at least 1 of the Array items.

Some types in dynamic languages, however, we can be more flexible with. For example, while interfaces aren't natively supported, can we test for that. An example is detecting if something is a Promise. While Promise is a native class in JavaScript, a lot of implementations of Promise have cropped up in the past decade while waiting for the API be officially implemented by browsers.\nInstead of being strict like we were with every around a party member, we'll see if it has the then of a Promise or Promise like library, or JQuery's done:\n```javascript\nconst { isFunction, get } = require('lodash')\nconst hasThen = o =>\n    isFunction(get(o, 'then'))\nconst hasDone = o =>\n    isFunction(get(o, 'done'))\nconst isPromiseLike = o =>\n    hasThen(o) && hasDone(o)\n"},"part4/":{"url":"part4/","title":"Part 4: Curry and Partial Application","keywords":"","body":"Why vs. How Curry Works\nIf you're more interested in how currying can help you in your current work vs the how it works, skip this and the following 5 sections and go to the Lodash FP section. It compares and contrasts the 2 libraries giving you insights into how function currying and partial applications can be useful in your work.\nCurry and Partial Application\nCurrying, or function currying, is when you make all functions take 1 argument, even those that normal need more. This means if you have a function that takes 2 arguments to do something useful, if you call it with 1 argument, it'll return a function. If you call that returned function with 1 argument, it'll then return the result. It's named after the guy who invented the technique, Haskell Brooks Curry.\nWhy in the world would you ever do this bizarre practice?\nWhen you start using pure functions, you'll notice that your functions start to have a lot of arguments. Features like default arguments, variable number of arguments, or referencing class variables that significantly reduce how many arguments your functions need are discouraged. If a pure function must declare it's dependencies to the outside world in its function parameters, then if it starts to compose other functions who have needs, then those are all added together into a lot of function arguments needed to run the function.\nDynamic languages also have pure abstractions to ensure no runtime errors. Things like get, set, lenses to safely access and set data, try/catch for ensuring no errors as side effects, and using the Factory design pattern for creating complex Objects many JavaScript libraries need to initialize themselves. All of this adds verbosity you don't have in type compiled languages.\nEntropy of Simplicity\nTo determine if something is a String only requires 1 argument: \nconst isString = o => typeof o === 'string'\n\nMaking an HTTP call requires both the http module and the URL:\nconst getDataFromServer = (request, url) => {\n    ...\n}\n\nLogging customer financial transactions to your audit logging server for safe keeping requires... well... a lot:\nconst getAuditLogger = (\n    kafkaClient, \n    kafkaOptions, \n    sslOptions, \n    environment,\n    region,\n    schemaID,\n    dataVerificationID\n) => {\n    ...\n}\n\nPure to be sure, but wow... is this what it's like in the real world?\nThe solution is to use function currying, partial applications as arguments, and good old examining your requirements and code to ensure your functions are as simple as possible.\n"},"part4/curry.html":{"url":"part4/curry.html","title":"All Functions Take 1 Argument","keywords":"","body":"Curry: All Functions Take 1 Argument\nFunction currying was originally created to make functions easier to work in math equations. In real world functional programming, you use them to:\n\nshorten how many arguments a function requires\nwrite less code\ncreate reusable functions from other functions\nwrite in point free style\nexpose useful functions for developers using our code\nmake it easier to creat partial applications so you can more easily compose functions\n\nManual Currying\nLet's manually curry an existing function. If you want to make a GET call using the pure function below, you need 2 parameters:\nconst loadWebsite = (request, url) =>\n    new Promise( ( success, failure ) )\n        request.get(url, (error, response, html) =>\n            error\n            ? failure(error)\n            : success(html)\n\nIf we call it, you have internet, and my website isn't broken again, you'll get gallons of HTML back, so I do just the 15 characters to show the doctype tag:\nconst request = require('request')\nloadWebsite(request, 'http://jessewarden.com')\n.then(html => console.log(html.substring(0, 15)))\n.catch(error => console.log(\"error:\", error))\n// \n\nTo curry it, we need to ensure all functions only take 1 parameter. If a function, like our loadWebsite needs 2 to do something useful, it'll return a function for the 1st parameter, and then the Promise for the 2nd since that function returns a Promise:\nconst loadWebsite = (request) => (url) =>\n        new Promise( ( success, failure ) =>\n            request.get(url, (error, response, html) =>\n                error\n                ? failure(error)\n                : success(html)\n            )\n        )\n\nI've kept the parenthesis to help you visualize we're creating a series of functions that only have 1 argument. Same function, we've just changed this:\nconst loadWebsite = (request, url) =>\n\nTo this:\nconst loadWebsite = (request) => (url) =>\n\nLet's call it with 1 argument:\nconst newFunctionCallWhoDis = loadWebsite(request)\nconsole.log(\"wat the:\", newFunctionCallWhoDis)\n// wat the: (url) =>\n//         new Promise( ( success, failure ) =>\n//             request.get(url, (error, response, html) =>\n//                 error\n//                 ? failure(error)\n//                 : success(html)\n//             )\n//         )\n\nCool, it's a function that takes a url and will make a request. Notice the request is nowhere to be found in the function arguments.\nLet's call that returned function:\nconst result = newFunctionCallWhoDis('http://jessewarden.com')\nconsole.log(\"result:\", result)\n// result: Promise {  }\n\nThat function when called returns us a Promise and makes an HTTP call. First parameter gives us a function, calling that function with the URL actually does the work.\nCan we call that on 1 line?\nloadWebsite(request)('http://jessewarden.com')\n.then(html => console.log(html.substring(0, 15)))\n.catch(error => console.log(\"error:\", error))\n// \n\nSame result as before. When dealing with curried functions, they only ever take 1 argument, so call them like that.\nOld function that had 2 arguments was called like this using only 2 parenthesis and a comma:\nloadWebsite(request, 'http://jessewarden.com')\n\nNew, curried function is called like this using 4 parenthesis and no comma:\nloadWebsite(request)('http://jessewarden.com')\n\nFunctions Returning Functions\nYou may not be used to functions returning functions. In many programming languages, functions are treated just like variables.\nconst name = 'Jesse'\nconst singSong = () => {\n    console.log('üé∂ Copy Pasta Coding üé∂')\n    setTimeout(() => {\n        console.log(\"... for the win.\")\n    }, 1000)\n}\n\nconst whoDat = (name, song) => {\n    console.log(\"name is:\", name)\n    // song is a function, whatever you\n    // pass in, this function will call it\n    // with no arguments\n    song()\n}\n\nwhoDat(name, singSong)\n// name is: Jesse\n// üé∂ Copy Pasta Coding üé∂\n// ... for the win.\n\nNote whether we pass a function a String or a Function, it's cool with either. Same goes for return values:\nconst sayMyName = name => {\n    const youAreAwesome = () => {\n        console.log(`${name} is...\n\n        _______ _  _  _ _______ _______  _____  _______ _______\n        |_____| |  |  | |______ |______ |     | |  |  | |______\n        |     | |__|__| |______ ______| |_____| |  |  | |______\n`)\n    }\n    return youAreAwesome\n}\n\nconst PowerMan = sayMyName('Luke Cage')\nPowerMan()\n/*\nLuke Cage is...\n\n        _______ _  _  _ _______ _______  _____  _______ _______\n        |_____| |  |  | |______ |______ |     | |  |  | |______\n        |     | |__|__| |______ ______| |_____| |  |  | |______\n*/\n\nI can make a function that takes dynamic arguments, and store it for later.\nconst getTensionBreaker = () => {\n    const phraseThatPays = [\n        'That Girl is...',\n        'Take me down to the Paradise City...',\n        'Yo...

While not pure, they work great:\nconst request = require('request')\n\nconst loadWebsite = url =>\n    new Promise( ( success, failure ) )\n        request.get(url, (error, response, html) =>\n            error\n            ? failure(error)\n            : success(html)\n\nAnd if you want that more pure:\nconst loadWebsite = (request, url) =>\n    new Promise( ( success, failure ) =>\n        request.get(url, (error, response, html) =>\n            error\n            ? failure(error)\n            : success(html)\n        )\n    )\n\nAnd then, to save people form having to manually put in request because we all know you're going to use request as the 1st parameter anyway:\nconst request = require('request')\nconst loadWebsiteWithRequest = url => loadWebsite(request, url)\n\nYou'll note, that closure example looks a lot like the curried version, but the curried version below is less code:\nconst request = require('request')\nconst loadWebsiteWithRequest = loadWebsite(request)\n\nOne Or No Arguments\nIf a function has 1 argument, it cannot be curried... because that's the last argument needed to run the function and do the real work. While curried functions ensure all functions they manage take 1 argument, they themselves are only needed if a function takes more than 1 argument.\nThese functions will always return a Promise:\nloadWebsiteWithRequest('http://jessewarden.com')\nloadWebsiteWithRequest('http://google.com')\n\nThe same goes for a function with no arguments:\nconst loadJesseWardenDotKizzohm = () => loadWebsiteWithRequest('http://jessewarden.com')\n\n"},"part4/parameter_order.html":{"url":"part4/parameter_order.html","title":"Parameter Order","keywords":"","body":"Known Knowns, and Known Unknowns\nFunction currying won't help you unless the arguments are in a good order.

The dynamic things, or things you won't know until the last possible moment, you put to the right (last).\nYou've seen our loadWebsite function from before, let's make a browser ES6 version that compensates for older browsers:\nimport fetch from 'cross-fetch'\n\nconst loadJSON = (fetch, url) =>\n    fetch(url)\n    .then(response => response.json())\n\nHere's the closure version:\nconst loadJSONWithFetch = url => loadJSON(fetch, url)\n\nHere's the curried version:\nconst loadJSON = fetch => url =>\n    fetch(url)\n    .then(response => response.json())\n\nconst loadJSONWithFetch = url => loadJSON(fetch)\n\nKnown: fetch will be used.\nUnknown: url, we don't know what it is yet.\nBoth bake in the fetch since we know we'll be using that class; we're just following pure function rules.\n... however, watch what happens if we put the dynamic stuff to the left, and the known stuff to the right.\nconst loadJSON = (url, fetch) =>\n    fetch(url)\n    .then(response => response.json())\n\nFor the closure, it still works, we just move url first, and fetch second:\nconst loadJSONWithFetch = url => loadJSON(url, fetch)\n\nFor the curried function, though... it doesn't work at all:\nconst loadJSON = url => fetch =>\n    fetch(url)\n    .then(response => response.json())\n\nconst loadJSONWithFetch = url =>loadJSON(url)(... er... what the heck goes here...)\n\nYou'd have to know the URL first before you can call it again with fetch. Could we use a closure to fix it?\nconst loadJSONWithFetch = url => loadJSON(url)(fetch)\n\nScore one for closures. As you can see, curried functions aren't forgiving when dynamic stuff is left, and known stuff is right. This is compounded when you have a lot more arguments.\nPractice Makes Perfect\nDon't fret if you continually refactor argument order until it feels right, it'll develop as a habit with practice. Like with muscle memory that you learn from physical sports and exercise. Muscle memory is actually a cache of common movement tasks your brain stores for quick access. The more you do it, the more your brain caches & improves how quickly and easily you can do the movement on instinct, without thinking. So too with parameter order.

While console.log will only show the loadURL portion, you and I know how closures work, and that request parameter value is up there, already defined, and waiting for loadURL to run and reference it.\nconst loadWebsite = request => {\n    const loadURL = url => new Promise( ( success, failure ) =>\n        request.get(url, (error, response, html) =>\n            error\n            ? failure(error)\n            : success(html)\n        )\n    )\n    return loadURL\n}\n\nMaking Your Own Partial Applications\nYou can certainly make your own without using curried functions. The cliche say hello function:\nconst sayHello = name => {\n    const yo = () => `Sup ${name}!`\n    return yo\n}\nconst heyJesse = sayHello('Jesse')\nheyJesse() // Sup Jesse!\n\nYou can use it build more dynamic ones, in the case of detecting if a browser supports the native fetch or not:\nimport * as polyfill from 'cross-fetch'\n\nconst loadJSON = (fetch, url) =>\n    fetch(url)\n    .then(response => response.json())\n\nconst loadJSONWithFetch = url => {\n    if(browserSupportsFetch() {\n        return url => loadJSON(fetch, url)\n    }\n    return url => {\n        console.warn(\"Dude, use a newer browser... please, beg your IT Admin. Your boss. Anyone.\")\n        return loadJSON(polyfill, url)\n    }\n}\n\nThe loadJSONWithFetch will return a partial application. If a browser supports the native fetch, it'll return a loadJSON function that uses the native fetch and is waiting for you supply the URL. Otherwise, it returns one that uses the polyfill and logs a warning to the console output. Users won't see this, but it's therapeutic.\nCreating Partial Applications Using partial\nLodash and Ramda also have ways of creating these in a pure way. If we have the loadWebsite non-curried function:\nconst loadWebsite = (request, url) =>\n    new Promise( ( success, failure ) =>\n        request.get(url, (error, response, html) =>\n            error\n            ? failure(error)\n            : success(html)\n        )\n    )\n\nWhile it's pure and allows us to easily unit test it by stubbing request, we want to expose it as a public function in our API with request baked in. That way, users can just go loadWebsite('my url') vs. having to import request.\nIf it were curried, we could just do this:\n// Node's CommonJS\nmodule.exports = {\n    loadWebsite: loadWebsite(request)\n}\n\n// ES6\nexport const loadWebsiteWithRequest = loadWebsite(request)\n\nInstead rewriting the function to be manually curried, or using of the various curry functions Lodash, Ramda, and other libraries have, we can instead just create a partial directly using the partial function from Lodash.\n// Node's CommonJS\nconst { partial } = require('lodash')\n\nmodule.exports = {\n    loadWebsite: partial(loadWebsite, [request])\n}\n\n// ES6\nimport { partial } from 'lodash'\n\nexport const loadWebsiteWithRequest = partial(loadWebsite, [request])\n\nIf you were to write that manually, without currying or partial applications, while impure, it'd be:\n// Node's CommonJS\nmodule.exports = {\n    loadWebsite: url => loadWebsite(request, url)\n}\n\n// ES6\nexport const loadWebsiteWithRequest = url => loadWebsite(request, url)\n\nThis is being polite to the developers using our code.\nIf we just did:\nmodule.exports = { loadWebsite }\n\nThen the developer would have to first import the request module to make our module work:\nconst { loadWebsite } = require('./loaders')\nconst request = require('request')\n\nloadWebsite(request, 'http://jessewarden.com')\n\nLame! Since we've exposed partial applications, they have to do less work, yet we've ensured we're still creating pure functions for unit testing and for others to use:\nconst { loadWebsite } = require('./loaders')\n\nloadWebsite('http://jessewarden.com')\n\nYou'll often expose both functions, usually only for testing purposes:\nmodule.exports = {\n    loadWebsite,\n    loadWebsiteWithRequest: partial(loadWebsite, [request])\n}\n\n// ES6\nexport const loadWebsite = ...\nexport const loadWebsiteWithRequest = partial(loadWebsite, [request])\n\nPartial Application With No Arguments\nWhile partial is a pure way to create partial applications without using currying, it can also create partial applications that take no arguments, something you can't do with currying. You can use this technique for integration testing using the unit test runner Mocha. Assuming you have 2 REST API's for /ping and /get/users running on localhost:\nconst ping = partial(loadWebsite, [request, 'http://localhost:3000/ping'])\nconst getUsers = partial(loadWebsite, [request, 'http://localhost:3000/get/users'])\n\nbeforeEach(() => {\n    // if ping responds, we can start running integration tests,\n    // otherwise, if the server isn't up, no point in running the tests.\n    return ping()\n})\nit('when /get/users is called, it should get a list of users', () => {\n    return getUsers()\n    .then(users => {\n        expect(users[0].firstName).to.not.be.empty\n    })\n})\n\nFixing Argument Order with partialRight\nWe saw in the Parameter Order section that the curried function had the arguments in a non-useful order. We used a function closure to create our own partial application:\nconst loadJSON = url => fetch =>\n    fetch(url)\n    .then(response => response.json())\n\nconst loadJSONWithFetch = url => loadJSON(url)(fetch)\n\nWe baked in fetch above, all you need to supply is the url. While we wanted loadJSON to have fetch first, instead of changing the function, we just fix it with loadJSONWithFetch fixing the order of the arguments by abstracting that away from us.\nHowever, loadJSONWithFetch isn't pure because the fetch isn't declared in the arguments. We can't make it pure using partial because she starts putting in arguments from the left:\nconst loadJSONWithFetch = partial(loadJSON, [... er, what do I put here, fetch])\n\nThankfully, there is something called partialRight, which instead of preloading arguments from left to right... it'll instead start from right to left.\nconst { partialRight } = require('lodash')\n\nconst loadJSONWithFetch = partialRight(loadJSON, [fetch])\n\nThe closure version of that would look like:\nconst loadJSONWithFetch = url => loadJSON(url, fetch)\n\nNow you can call it with the url at your leisure:\nloadJSONWithFetch('http://jessewarden.com')\n.then(console.log)\n.catch(console.log)\n\nThe partialRight is pure unlike the closure which is not, and can support functions that are written with static things that are on the right (latter/last in the argument list) instead of left (first or early in the parameter list).\nIf it's 3rd party code, or you're on a deadline, partialRight can be a lifesaver. If it's your code, fix the parameter order instead of using this function.\n"},"part4/closures_and_immutability.html":{"url":"part4/closures_and_immutability.html","title":"Closures And Immutability","keywords":"","body":"Closures And Immutability\nA closure is an function that encloses something. Everytime a function is created, it creates a closure, and each has rules about what scope it can and cannot access. Many seasoned dynamic language developers know about scope and closures. We're covering it here because it can help in immutability, violate it, and is the way in which we create curried functions.\nBasic Closure\nThe function below returns a function. That function uses the closure it was defined in to access message so it can log it out. It's private, no one else can modify that message variable, or affect the behavior of the returned function.\nconst sup = () => {\n    const message = \"hey\"\n    return () => console.log(message)\n}\n\nTo use it:\nconst sayHey = sup()\nsayHey() // hey\nsayHey() // hey\nsayHey() // hey\n\nData Privacy\nThat data privacy is an important concept to remember. In Object Oriented Programming, it was how you enforce private variables before the advent of private methods and accessors or transpilers such as TypeScript which have private and protected. For functional programming, it's how we enforce, and prevent accidental, mutation. More importantly, it's how we reduce side effects.\nHere's a pure function for pinging a URL. We're stubbing requesthere:\nconst request = { head: _ => Promise.resolve(\"It worked.\") }\nconst ping = (request, url) =>\n    request.head(url)\n\nHowever, it's a bit of a pain to supply request everytime:\nping(request, 'http://google.com').then(log) // It worked.\nping(request, 'http://jessewarden.com').then(log) // It worked.\n\nSo we create a curried function instead to utilize a partial application:\nconst ping = request => url =>\n    request.head(url)\n\nNow, we create the default parameter version once:\nconst headURL = ping(request)\n\nAnd use it with just the 1 parameter we care about:\nheadURL('http://google.com').then(log) // It worked.\nheadURL('http://jessewarden.com').then(log) // It worked.\n\nViolating Data Privacy\n... but what happens if we modify request after the 1st call?\nheadURL('http://google.com').then(log).catch(log)\nrequest.head = _ =>\n    Promise.reject(new Error('heh, not immutable, dat boom'))\nheadURL('http://jessewarden.com').then(log)\n\nWe get:\nIt worked.\n(node:19713) UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: Error: heh, not immutable, dat boom\nWhile using closures for data privacy is the core of how curried functions work in JavaScript, they still obey data by reference rules. Closures are not a panacea for immutability. If you mutate their references elsewhere, the closure doesn't have an immutable copy. While it can seem obvious that you can violating pure functions by mutating data, you'll often be working with code that may do this for unit testing purposes, or other reasons. If you're getting impure results, don't be afraid to whip out Object.freeze to see who is violating immutability. Ensure you put 'use strict' up top in Node to trigger the exceptions.\n'use strict'\nconst request = Object.freeze({ head: _ => Promise.resolve(\"It worked.\") })\n\nI don't recommend leaving Object.freeze in your code because it's a broken window. Instead, focus on finding the mutation and fixing it unless it's something requiring herculean effort to change like how your unit testing framework works. \n"},"part4/arity.html":{"url":"part4/arity.html","title":"Arity","keywords":"","body":"How Many Arguments Does a Function Take\nFunction arity refers to how many arguments it takes. Functions in JavaScript are super dynamic, and these rules can differ between other dynamic languages like Python, Lua, and Ruby. It's important to know what arity means when you start talking about curried functions and partial applications.\nAn arity of 0 means none:\nconst alwaysTrue = () => true\nalwaysTrue() // true\n\nAn arity of 1 means one:\nconst sup = name => console.log(`Sup ${name}!`)\nsup('Jesse') // Sup Jesse!\n\nAn arity of 2 means two:\nconst loadWebsite = (request, url) => {\n    ...\n}\n\n... and so on.\nFunction.prototype.length\nYou can test this with Function Declarations, Function Expressions, and Arrow Functions by checking the length property of the function.\nNone:\nfunction alwaysTrue() {\n    return true\n}\nalwaysTrue.length // 0\n\nOne:\nconst sup = function(name) {\n    console.log(`Sup ${name}!`)\n}\nsup.length // 1\n\nTwo:\nconst loadWebsite = (request, url) => {\n    ...\n}\nloadWebsite.length // 2\n\nDefault Arguments\nBe aware default arguments will change the length property.\nconst loadWebsite = (request, url='http://jessewarden.com') => {\n    ...\n}\nloadWebsite.length // 1\n\nAlthough loadWebsite takes 2 parameters, we default the 2nd one to my website. Therefore, the function really only takes 1 parameter, but you can supply a 2nd if you want to, if not we'll just default to a usable value.\nIf you make them both have defaults, then it will have an arity of 0 \"because you don't have to pass both if you don't want to\":\nconst loadWebsite = (requestModule=request, url='http://jessewarden.com') => {\n    ...\n}\nloadWebsite.length // 0\n\nHowever, this gets a bit weird if the first has a default, but the 2nd does not:\nconst loadWebsite = (requestModule=request, url) => {\n    ...\n}\nloadWebsite.length // 0\n\nWhile the first parameter has a default, the 2nd does not and is required. Yet, JavaScript sees the default and stops counting.\narguments and rest\nFunction Declarations have an arguments local variable that refers to the arguments you passed the function:\nfunction loadWebsite(request, url) {\n    console.log(\"arguments:\", arguments)\n}\nloadWebsite({ wat: 'fake request'}, 'http://jessewarden.com')\n// { '0': { wat: 'fake request' }, '1': 'http://jessewarden.com' }\nloadWebsite.length // 2\n\nOften used for more dynamic than usual dynamic programming, you can not even declare arguments, and just use the arguments object to identify what the user passed into the function call. We'll just remove the arguments, but the function works the same:\nfunction loadWebsite() {\n    console.log(\"arguments:\", arguments)\n}\nloadWebsite({ wat: 'fake request'}, 'http://jessewarden.com')\n// { '0': { wat: 'fake request' }, '1': 'http://jessewarden.com' }\nloadWebsite.length // 0\n\nNote although the first version had an arity of 2, the second has an arity of 0.\nYou can do the same using Arrow Functions via rest parameters:\nconst loadWebsite = (...args) => {\n    console.log(\"args:\", args)\n}\nloadWebsite({ wat: 'fake request'}, 'http://jessewarden.com')\n// [ { wat: 'fake request' }, 'http://jessewarden.com' ]\nloadWebsite.length // 0\n\nHowever, it'll interpret the rest parameters just like default arguments; the function arity is 0.\nVariadic: Infinite Parameters\nA lot of dynamic languages are variadic by default, meaning they take an infinite amount of parameters.\nFor example, if we want to dynamically add friends to the party, we can:\nconst { reduce, toArray } = require('lodash')\n\nconst party = [\n    {\n        name: 'Jesse',\n        clazz: 'Swashbuckler'\n    }\n]\n\nfunction addFriendOrFriendsToParty(party) {\n    const membersToAdd = toArray(arguments)\n    membersToAdd.shift()\n    return reduce(\n        membersToAdd, \n        (currentParty, member) => {\n            return [...currentParty, member]\n        },\n        party\n    )\n}\n\nNow, we can add 1:\naddFriendOrFriendsToParty(party, { name: 'Brandy', clazz: 'Cleric' })\n// [ { name: 'Jesse', clazz: 'Swashbuckler' },\n//   { name: 'Brandy', clazz: 'Cleric' } ]\n\nOr... 4:\naddFriendOrFriendsToParty(\n    party, \n    { name: 'Brandy', clazz: 'Cleric' },\n    { name: 'Albus', clazz: 'War Dog' },\n    { name: 'Robo', clazz: 'Bard' },\n    { name: 'Sydney', clazz: 'Mage' }\n)\n// [ { name: 'Jesse', clazz: 'Swashbuckler' },\n//   { name: 'Brandy', clazz: 'Cleric' },\n//   { name: 'Albus', clazz: 'War Dog' },\n//   { name: 'Robo', clazz: 'Bard' },\n//   { name: 'Sydney', clazz: 'Mage' } ]\n\nThis is built into JavaScript functions of all types. We've intentionally provided arguments to help the user the of function figure out what to pass, however, JavaScript functions work with/without parameters. There is no runtime enforcement of passing too little or too many. Too little, it'll default to undefined. Too many, it'll ignore them.\nFor example, although the alwaysTrue function below takes no parameters:\nconst alwaysTrue = () => true\n\n... we can still call it with 7 parameters, it'll still work, and we'll still get our expected result back:\nconst result = alwaysTrue(false, 47, new Error('OH LOOK AT THE TIME'), {dat: 'pot pie tho'}, Array, () => {}, Math.Infinity)\nconsole.log(result) // true\n\nConclusions\nNow you can see why functional programming with curried functions doesn't really play well with default arguments, nor variable arguments through arguments or rest parameters. Be aware Lodash, Ramda, Folktale, and Sanctuary do support some of these edge cases.\n"},"part4/styles_of_curry.html":{"url":"part4/styles_of_curry.html","title":"Styles Of Curry","keywords":"","body":"Different Styles of Curry\nWe've shown you how to manually create curried functions. However, many dynamic languages, especially JavaScript, use a lot of libraries and most aren't written in a functional way. Just like you can use promisify in Node to convert a callback function to a Promise based one, Lodash, Ramda, Folktale, and Sanctuary have a curry function to convert non-curried functions to curried ones.\nThese help in:\n\nhelp beginners ease into curried functions\nusing 3rd party code you don't own\ncode you've already written and want to quickly convert\nexpose public functions that doesn't force curried function calling style onto those using the API who may not be FP developers\n\nLodash' & Ramda's curry\nInstead of converting our loadWebsite function to be manually curried, we can instead use Lodash's curry function:\nconst { curry } = require('lodash')\n\nconst loadWebsite = (request, url) =>\n    new Promise( ( success, failure ) =>\n        request.get(url, (error, response, html) =>\n            error\n            ? failure(error)\n            : success(html)\n        )\n    )\n\nconst loadWebsiteCurried = curry(loadWebsite)\n\nNow, we can make a partial application:\nconst loadWebsiteWithRequest = loadWebsiteCurried(request)\n\nOr just call the function:\nloadWebsiteCurried(request)('http://jessewarden.com')\n\nWhat's cool, though, is it's a lot more flexible and nicer to beginners. You can also call it like a regular function:\nloadWebsiteCurried(request, 'http://jessewarden.com')\n\nDoesn't even look curried, but can act like it if you need to.\nCurry Arity & Style with Lodash, Ramda, Folktale, and Sanctuary\nLodash, Ramda, Folktale, and Sanctuary differ in how they report function arity. Arity means how many arguments a function takes. You can learn more in the Arity section. Some frameworks such as Express care about a function's arity. \nLet's compare these non-default argument, non-variadic functions:\nconst alwaysTrue = () => true\nalwaysTrue.length // 0\n\nconst loadWebsite = (request, url) => {\n    console.log(\"Load stuff.\")\n}\nloadWebsite.length // 2\n\nLodash\nLodash will report an arity of 0 always. It supports function calling in curried style (a)(b), imperative style (a, b), and mixed (a, b)(c):\nconst { curry } = require('lodash')\n\ncurry(alwaysTrue).length // 0\ncurry(loadWebsite).length // 0\n\nRamda\nRamda will report the length of the original function which is helpful if you intend to use this function in frameworks who care about function arity or you're not sure how many parameters a function requires. Sometimes you'll call a function and you'll be confused why you're getting a function back instead a Promise or some other expected value, so checking the function length can help, at least with Ramda. It supports function calling in curried style (a)(b), imperative style (a, b), and mixed (a, b)(c):\nconst { curry } = require('ramda')\n\ncurry(alwaysTrue).length // 0\ncurry(loadWebsite).length // 2\n\nFolktale\nFolktale requires you to define the function arity ahead of time, but like Lodash reports 0 no matter what you put. Like Lodash and Ramda, it supports function calling in curried style (a)(b), imperative style (a, b), and mixed (a, b)(c):\nconst curry = require('folktale/core/lambda/curry')\n\ncurry(0, alwaysTrue).length // 0\ncurry(2, loadWebsite).length // 0\n\nSanctuary\nSanctuary cares about types, and as such, doesn't support taking in variadic functions to convert to curried functions. Instead, you have to choose the arity ahead of time using one of their functions. They support curry2, curry3, curry4, and curry5. Unlike the others, it technically reports the correct number of 1, despite the number in curry2 or the others being bigger than 1. It only supports a curry style (a)(b) of calling functions.\nconst { curry2 } = require('sanctuary')\n\ncurry2(alwaysTrue).length // 1\ncurry2(loadWebsite).length // 1\n\nConclusions\nIf you're just starting out, use Lodash or Ramda. Ramda's curry is safer for use in cases where function arity needs to be correct. Manual currying is great, and you should practice to make it feel more natural. However, using curry is great for 3rd party code, your own code that isn't curried, and exposing functions to users who don't know what currying is and expect functions to work \"like the normally do\".\n"},"part4/lodash_fp.html":{"url":"part4/lodash_fp.html","title":"Lodash FP","keywords":"","body":"The 5 Stages of Learning Function Currying\nThere are 5 stages of learning function currying:\n\ncreating closures\ncreating partial applications\nusing curried functions to create partial applications\ncreating curried functions\nEVERYTHING IS A CURRIED FUNCTION\n???\n\nThis book assumes you've already comfortable with #1. Part 4: Partial Applications handles #2.\nBelow, we'll get you more practice at #2 with less work, and the beginnings of seeing how #3 works.\nLodash vs Lodash FP\nLodash provides another version of itself called \"Lodash FP\", which stands for Lodash Functional Programming. The 2 features that make it appealing are:\n\nAll methods are curried\nall data is immutable\n\nThis is a wonderful tool to slowly start using partial applications, get comfortable using curried functions in different styles, and start creating your own. Most of the functions Lodash have in Lodash/fp are there, just their arguments are reversed to be static left, dynamic right.\nget\nUsing a deeply nested Object:\nconst person = {\n    firstName: 'Jesse',\n    lastName: 'Warden',\n    age: 39,\n    address: {\n        home: {\n            street: '007 Cow Lane',\n            phone: ['123-456-7890']\n        },\n        work: {\n            street: '123 Work Blvd'\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nUsing regular Lodash to get the firstName:\nconst { get } = require('lodash')\n\nconst firstName = get(person, 'firstName')\nconsole.log(firstName) // Jesse\n\nNote the static/known variable, the property we're looking for, firstName is last, and the dynamic piece of data person is first.\nLet's see that in lodash/fp:\nconst { get } = require('lodash/fp')\n\nconst firstName = get('firstName', person)\nconsole.log(firstName) // Jesse\n\nNote the static/known variable, the property we're looking for, firstName is first this time, and the dynamic piece of data person is last. This makes it easier to create a re-usable function as a partial application like so:\nconst getFirstName = get('firstName')\nconst firstName = getFirstName(person)\nconsole.log(firstName) // Jesse\n\nThe get function takes 2 arguments. We only gave it 1. The return value from get('firstName') is a function, a partial application, that's waiting for some object so it can see if it has a firstName property or not.\nIf you were only allowed to use lodash, you could do that using partialRight:\nconst { get, partialRight } = require('lodash')\n\nconst getFirstName = partialRight(get, ['firstName'])\nconst firstName = getFirstName(person)\nconsole.log(firstName) // Jesse\n\nCool, but gross. The partialRight creates a function, a partial application, that looks like:\nconst getFirstName = person => get(person, 'firstName')\n\nThese are two of the ways lodash/fp is useful, specifically around creating re-usable partial applications with a convenient argument order built for currying.\nmap\nAll the list comprehensions in lodash/fp like map, filter, etc. are the same as well with arguments basically reversed. Given we have a list party:\nconst party = [\n    { name: 'Jesse', clazz: 'Swasbuckler' },\n    { name: 'Brandy', clazz: 'Cleric' },\n    { name: 'Albus', clazz: 'War Dog' }\n]\n\nWe'll use Lodash to turn that into a list of names using get and map:\nconst { map, get } = require('lodash')\n\nconst names = map(\n    party, \n    person => get(person, 'name')\n)\nconsole.log(names) // [ 'Jesse', 'Brandy', 'Albus' ]\n\nAnd the same in lodash/fp:\nconst { map, get } = require('lodash/fp')\n\nconst names = map(\n    get('name'),\n    party\n)\nconsole.log(names) // [ 'Jesse', 'Brandy', 'Albus' ]\n\nNote 2 things. The function used to do the map is first instead of second. You'll usually know the function you're using to map first anyway, and the array you want to map over last. Also notice instead of defining a new function like we did for lodash using person => get(person, 'name'), we instead just use get('name'). Both do the same thing, one just returns a partial application, and is shorter to write.\nFunctions That Make Functions That Make Functions\nLet's expand this re-use of partial applications one step further. Given we have bunch of parties:\nconst fortuneWardens = [\n    { name: 'Jesse', clazz: 'Swasbuckler' },\n    { name: 'Brandy', clazz: 'Cleric' },\n    { name: 'Albus', clazz: 'War Dog' }\n]\nconst icewindDale = [\n    { name: 'Bruenor', clazz: 'Fighter' },\n    { name: 'Drizzt', clazz: 'Ranger' },\n    { name: 'Wulfgar', clazz: 'Barbarian' },\n    { name: 'Catti-brie', clazz: 'Fighter' },\n    { name: 'Regis', clazz: 'Thief' }\n]\nconst work = [\n    { name: 'Cal', clazz: 'Developer' },\n    { name: 'John', clazz: 'Developer' },\n    { name: 'Jesse', clazz: 'Developer' }\n]\n\nLet's create a re-usable map in Lodash:\nconst getNames = party => map(\n    party, \n    person => get(person, 'name')\n)\ngetNames(fortuneWardens)\n// [ 'Jesse', 'Brandy', 'Albus' ]\ngetNames(icewindDale)\n// [ 'Jesse', 'Brandy', 'Albus' ]\ngetNames(work)\n// [ 'Cal', 'John', 'Jesse' ]\n\nAnd the same in lodash/fp:\nconst getNames = map(get('name'))\ngetNames(fortuneWardens)\n// [ 'Jesse', 'Brandy', 'Albus' ]\ngetNames(icewindDale)\n// [ 'Jesse', 'Brandy', 'Albus' ]\ngetNames(work)\n// [ 'Cal', 'John', 'Jesse' ]\n\nThe two getName functions are drastically different in size; this should drive home how powerful partial applications and currying are and inspire you to start using lodash/fp. Do more with less code. Ramda & Sanctuary do this by default.\n"},"part5/":{"url":"part5/","title":"Part 5: Composition","keywords":"","body":"Composition\nFunction composition is combining functions together. It's how you build libraries, API's, and programs using Functional Programming. It's a well defined math term, and usually refers to combining Partial Applications together.\nHowever, there are a variety of ways to combine functions together. Pure Functions are the core awesomeness of Functional Programming. Showing the variety of ways you can use these in real world programming is helpful and justifies your hard work.\nWe'll cover passing functions as parameters, using various ways to compose function pipelines both sync and async, and finally tacit programming which is also called point free programming.\n"},"part5/passing_functions_to_functions.html":{"url":"part5/passing_functions_to_functions.html","title":"Passing Functions to Functions","keywords":"","body":"Passing Functions To Functions\nIn many languages, functions are treated as values. You can store them in variables:\nconst yo = () => console.log('yo')\n\nAnd passing them as values to other functions:\nconst yoDude = (greeting, name) => {\n    greeting()\n    console.log(` ${name}`)\n}\nyoDude(yo, 'Jesse!')\n// yo Jesse!\n\nExtra Functions in Callbacks\nThis concept is used in [callbacks]. Callbacks are a way to handle asynchronous programming in non-blocking languages like JavaScript and sometimes Python and Lua. If a function can't immediately return a value because it could take a while, and the programming language doesn't block, you hand it a function and say \"Call this when you're done\". This can happen for things you know will take a short while, like making REST calls to a server:\nconst dataReceived = (error, response, body) => console.log(\"This is what the serer sent back:\", body)\nrequest.get('http://jessewarden.com', dataReceived)\n\nIt can also be for things that could possibly take a long while or never happen, such as a user clicking a button like JQuery does:\n$( \"#submitButton\" ).click( () => alert(\"Submitted.\") )\n\nThis concept is so common, many developers will define those functions in the function call itself like the JQuery example above, instead of defining them in their own variable like the request example above.\nHowever, sometimes developers will create extra functions to be more clear, or because they have used console.log around the code for debugging purposes.\nconst showHTML = html => {\n    const smallVersion = html.substr(0, 100)\n    $(\".htmlResponse\").html(smallVersion)\n}\n\n$.get('http://jessewarden.com', html => showHTML(html))\n\nThey're creating an extra function in the callback. If you're not actively debugging, there is no need for that extra function. Instead, just put the callback in:\n$.get('http://jessewarden.com', showHTML)\n\nInternally, $.get will be in pseudo code:\n$.get = (url, callback) => {\n    // various work\n    callback(html)\n}\n\nWhich is basically the same as:\n$.get = (url) => {\n    // various work\n    showHTML(html)\n}\n\nSo why provide an extra function that does nothing but call the function?\n$.get = (url) => {\n    // various work\n    const extra = html => showHTML(html)\n    extra(html)\n}\n\nExtra Functions in Promises\nIn JavaScript, they've borrowed some of the best parts of Finite State Machines and Functional Programming to create Promises. They allow you chain together synchronous and asynchronous functions and work great with pure functions.\nHowever, the same problem developers do with creating extra functions in callbacks are worse in Promises, mainly because you'll have a lot more then functions to chain additional functions. Inline functions like examples show online for fetch are fine:\nfetch('http://example.com/movies.json')\n  .then(function(response) {\n    return response.json();\n  })\n  .then(function(myJson) {\n    console.log(myJson);\n  });\n\nThe 2nd then could be re-written to this and still do the same exact thing with 1 less function:\n.then(console.log)\n\nHowever, you could argue it's justified because:\n\nJavaScript is a dynamic language\nIntegreted Development Environments (IDE's) and various text editors used for coding are still bad at helping learn about your code and providing intellisense and code completion\nthe documentation is helping you understand what the implied response type is: an Object parsed from response.json()\nJavaScript isn't a typed like language and there are no type definitions\n\nOther notorious ones:\nconst members = [\n    { name: 'Jesse', type: 'human', hitPoints: 12, maxHitPoints: 24 },\n    { name: 'Brandy', type: 'human', hitPoints: 11, maxHitPoints: 11 }\n    { name: 'Albus', type: 'dawg', hitPoints: 5, maxHitPoints: 9 }\n]\n\nconst filterHumans = members => filter(member => member.type === 'human', members)\nconst filterLowHealth = members => filter(member => member.hitPoints !== member.maxHitPoints, members)\n\nPromise.resolve(members)\n.then(members => filterHumans(members))\n.then(humans => filterLowHealth(humans))\n.then(unhealthyHumans => console.log(\"Unhealthy humans:\", unhealthyHumans))\n\nWhatever function you put into then will be invoked automatically with 1 argument it receives. There is no reason for you define another function on top of it to that invokes your function:\n.then(members => filterHumans(members))\n\nThat's basically the same thing as:\nconst filterHumans = members => filter(member => member.type === 'human', members)\nconst filterHumansAgain = members => filterHumans(members)\n\n.then(filterHumansAgain)\n\nInstead, you can just write:\nPromise.resolve(members)\n.then(filterHumans)\n.then(filterLowHealth)\n.then(unhealthyHumans => console.log(\"Unhealthy humans:\", unhealthyHumans))\n\nConclusions\nWhile some could argue this is for performance reasons, we bring this up because using curried functions, partial applications, and tacit programming / point free style, you'll commonly provide functions with some or no arguments. Re-defining functions like this can remove your function purity, or accidentally hide what you're trying to do. Being comfortable writing, and more importantly, reading code like the shrunken Promise example above is important to successfully compose functions together. On the other hand, without types, or familiarity with a library, clearly written parameters can help in readability. Sometimes the extra function is worth it for cognitive load reasons.\n"},"part5/composing_functions.html":{"url":"part5/composing_functions.html","title":"Composing Functions","keywords":"","body":"Composing Functions\nComposing functions is when you combine a bunch of functions together to form a new function. When you build applications using Functional Programming, you'll be building new functions from existing functions. Flow in Lodash, Compose in Ramda, Folktale, and Sanctuary, allow you to pipe functions together in JavaScript. We briefly showed an example of this in the Tacit Programming section using flow. Python and Lua make this a lot easier since both synchronous things like adding numbers and asynchronous things like loading data from websites work the exact the same way if you use the basics of the language.\nJavaScript, however, handles asynchronous completely differently through Promises, Python optionally through their various concurrency options, and Lua through coroutines. We'll cover both below so you'll be deadly no matter which language you choose to wield.\nPrior Art\nA lot of languages and libraries already do some form of composition where you'll \"dot chain\" functions together to string together the output of one into the arguments of another.\nString and Array in plain JavaScript:\n'Jesse,Brandy'\n.split(',')\n.map(name => `${name} is crunk on vacay, urrrkaaayy!`)\n.sort()\n.join('\\n')\n.toUpperCase()\n// BRANDY IS CRUNK ON VACAY, URRRKAAAYY!\n// JESSE IS CRUNK ON VACAY, URRRKAAAYY!\n\nChaining selectors in JQuery:\n$(document).ready(() => {\n    $('#dvContent')\n    .addClass('dummy')\n    .css('color', 'red')\n    .fadeIn('slow');    \n})\n\nAnd straddling both the sync and async worlds of JavaScript using RxJS:\nconst { fromPromise, from } = require('rx')\n\nconst getLambdaFunctions = functions => \n    fromPromise(listAWSFunctions(functions))\n    .pluck('Functions')\n    .selectMany(from)\n    .filter(lambda => get('Runtime', lambda) === 'nodejs')\n    .filter(containsBasicRole)\n    .toArray()\n\nSync With Flow\nTo get a list of human names from our party in JSON will be a series of pure parsing functions. We'll compose them together keeping them as point-free as possible.\nOur party in JSON:\nconst peopleString = `[\n[\"jesse warden\", \"swasbuckler\", 18, 21, \"human\"],\n[\"brandy fortune\", \"cleric\", 11, 11, \"human\"],\n[\"albus dumbledog\", \"war dog\", 7, 9, \"dawg\"]\n]`\n\nParsing\nLet's create our function and continue to add to it so we can see the process of how composition start small and simple, yet can be augmented over time.\nimport { flow } from 'lodash/fp'\n\nconst showHumans = flow([JSON.parse])\n\nconsole.log(showHumans(peopleString))\n// [ [ 'jesse warden', 'swasbuckler', 18, 21, 'human' ],\n//   [ 'brandy fortune', 'cleric', 11, 11, 'human' ],\n//   [ 'albus dumbledog', 'war dog', 7, 9, 'dawg' ] ]\n\nThe JSON.parse function takes 1 parameter, a String, and will output the parsed JSON Object. It's not pure because it'll throw if the String fails to parse, but we'll handle that scenario in Part 6: Algebriac Data Types.\nList to People\nOur party members have their attributes flattened into an Array. Let's convert them to proper people Objects. e'll give the map our list of party members, and he'll destructure the Array into properties, then return them in an Object with the properties having the same name:\nconst listToPeople = map( ([name, clazz, hitPoints, maxHitPoints, type]) =>\n    ({ name, clazz, hitPoints, maxHitPoints, type })\n)\n\nPlugged into our flow, she'll get whatever JSON.parse spits out:\nconst showHumans = flow([\n    JSON.parse,\n    listToPeople\n])\n\nconsole.log(showHumans(peopleString))\n// [ { name: 'jesse warden',\n//     clazz: 'swasbuckler',\n//     hitPoints: 18,\n//     maxHitPoints: 21,\n//     type: 'human' },\n//   { name: 'brandy fortune',\n//     clazz: 'cleric',\n//     hitPoints: 11,\n//     maxHitPoints: 11,\n//     type: 'human' },\n//   { name: 'albus dumbledog',\n//     clazz: 'war dog',\n//     hitPoints: 7,\n//     maxHitPoints: 9,\n//     type: 'dawg' } ]\n\nFilter Humans\nLike we've shown in the previous section, if any of the person's type is a human, we keep those in the newly returned Array. This means no Albus in the filtered party Array.\nconst filterHumans =\n    filter(\n        person => getOr('unknown', 'type', person) === 'human'\n    )\n\nPlugging her in:\nconst showHumans = flow([\n    JSON.parse,\n    listToPeople,\n    filterHumans\n])\n\nconsole.log(showHumans(peopleString))\n// [ { name: 'jesse warden',\n//     clazz: 'swasbuckler',\n//     hitPoints: 18,\n//     maxHitPoints: 21,\n//     type: 'human' },\n//   { name: 'brandy fortune',\n//     clazz: 'cleric',\n//     hitPoints: 11,\n//     maxHitPoints: 11,\n//     type: 'human' } ]\n\nFix Name Casing\nWe can correct the casing of the names using Lodash' startCase method. It'll change 'jesse warden' to 'Jesse Warden'. We covered set in Part 3: Set, the function used to clone an Object and update a piece of data on the clone. We'll use both below to correct the casing of all the names on the human party members:\nconst formatNames =\n    map(\n        list => set('name', startCase(get('name', list)), list)\n    )\n\nPopping her in results in both names fixed:\nconst showHumans = flow([\n    JSON.parse,\n    listToPeople,\n    filterHumans,\n    formatNames\n])\n\nconsole.log(showHumans(peopleString))\n// [ { name: 'Jesse Warden',\n//     clazz: 'swasbuckler',\n//     hitPoints: 18,\n//     maxHitPoints: 21,\n//     type: 'human' },\n//   { name: 'Brandy Fortune',\n//     clazz: 'cleric',\n//     hitPoints: 11,\n//     maxHitPoints: 11,\n//     type: 'human' } ]\n\n"},"part5/tacit_programming.html":{"url":"part5/tacit_programming.html","title":"Tacit Programming","keywords":"","body":"Composition and Tacit Programming\nTacit Programming, which also goes by the name of point-free style, is a way to write functions without specifying their arguments. It's useful for:\n\nto write less code\nto help in composition of functions\nsame reason you use partial applications in reducing the amount of arguments you need to provide\n\nmap and get\nWe've already covered using curried functions from the Lodash FP section to reduce the amount of code you can write and to create re-usable functions from partial applications.\n// lodash\nconst getNames = party => map(\n    party, \n    person => get(person, 'name')\n)\n\n// lodash/fp\nconst getNames = map(get('name'))\n\nThose partial applications used in the lodash/fp exmple don't define their function parameters. Below, we compare the point style where they define the arguments, and point-free where they don't:\n// point style\nconst getName = object => get('name', object)\nconst mapNames = party => map(getName, party)\nconst getNames = party => mapNames(party)\n\n// point-free style\nconst getName = get('name')\nconst mapNames = map(getNames)\nconst getNames = mapNames\n\nPro's and Con's\nThere are 3 upsides to using point-free:\n\nless code\nsometimes less wasted functions\nsometimes you create re-usable functions\n\nThe map(get('name')) is much less code than map(party, person => get(person, 'name')), and we don't have to create functions merely to ensure the arguments are in the right order. Assuming the common stuff is the left/first parameter, we can create a lot of re-usable functions using partial applications by only passing in some of the arguments to curried functions.\nThere are 3 downsides to point-free, specific to dynamic languages:\n\nmemorize function signatures\nno types nor runtime assertions\nit's an extra step of \"thinking\"\n\nDo you know what get's function signature is? And map's? We've just covered it. How about reduce in lodash/fp instead of lodash? When you see map(get('name')), you have to have memorized what the function signatures are for get and map. If you haven't, then you have to go look them up, else you don't understand the code. One could argue you have the same problem for any abstraction, but do you have to do the same for this?\nconst getName = object => get('name', object)\nconst getNamesFromListOfObjects = party =>\n    map(\n        member => getName(member),\n        party\n    )\n\nNone of those functions are needed using lodash/fp, but we used them to be more clear. So you don't have to memorize the function signatures, nor force those reading your code to memorize them too. You don't have to think because the functions clearly list their function arguments, and use adjectives to give you hints as to what they are and what they might return.\nLet's give a few more examples to see if you like it or not. Sometimes you'll just have to pick and choose where you use it.\nValidating Data\nLet's validate data using lodash/fp in a point and point-free styles so we can contrast them. Validating data in dynamic languages typically is saying \"does it look like the Object I want?\" Unlike typed languages where \"it must be this type\" whether at compile time or runtime, in dynamic languages, you're like \"if it has a then, it's probably something that that acts like a Promise, so we can treat it like one in our system; good enough for government work!\"\nOur data:\nconst person = {\n    name: 'Jesse Warden',\n    address: {\n        street: '123 Cow Ville',\n        phone: [\n            '123-555-1234',\n            '999-555-8234'\n        ]\n    }\n}\n\nWe'll use has to verify the Object has a property we expect to find, and every to run through all the properties we're looking for. As long as it found all the properties, the Object is probably ok.\nconst { has, every } = require('lodash/fp')\n\nconst legitPerson = person =>\n    every(\n        hasResult => hasResult === true,\n        [\n            has('name', person),\n            has('address.street', person),\n            has('address.phone[0]', person)\n        ]\n    )\n\nconsole.log(legitPerson(person)) // true\n\nWe can reduce how verbose it is using point-free style on the has. Instead of populating the Array with a bunch of Booleans, we can instead populate it with a bunch of Functions. We still keep the original legitPerson point style, but at least reduce the contents of the function:\nconst legitPerson = person => every(\n    predicate => predicate(person),\n    [\n        has('name'),\n        has('address.street'),\n        has('address.phone[0]')\n    ]\n)\n\nconsole.log(legitPerson(person)) // true\n\nDefault Values via getOr with Filtering\ngetOr\nSometimes you want default values in case what you're trying to get doesn't exist. We've covered get in Part 2: Get, which allows you to safely get data. If the data isn't there, it'll return undefined. If you want to use default values in the case of undefined, however, it's a bit unwieldy:\nimport { get } from 'lodash/fp'\n\nconst getPersonType = person => {\n    let result = get('type', person)\n    if(result === undefined) {\n        result = 'unknown'\n    }\n    return result\n}\n\nWe can instead use getOr to say \"Maybe there is a value there... if it is, great, use it, otherwise just use the default.\"\nimport { getOr } from 'lodash/fp'\n\nconst getPersonType = person => getOr('unknown', 'type', person)\n\nOr point-free:\nconst getPersonType = getOr('unknown', 'type')\n\nI should point out, the regular Lodash version reads more naturally: \"from this Object, get the 'type', or just use 'unknown'\" whereas lodash/fp reads \"If we don't find anything use 'unknown', when looking for the 'type' property, on this Object\". Lesson: Curry friendly doesn't always mean reader friendly.\nUsing getOr and flow with filter\nPoint-free can either really help if you've memorized the API, or really harm, when you start composing functions together. As they get larger, you can prevent this from being too verbose via point-free style. Below we'll filter a list by only getting the humans using getOr and filter. Below is our needed imports and party:\nconst { getOr, filter } = require('lodash/fp')\n\nconst party = [\n    { name: 'Jesse', type: 'human' },\n    { name: 'Brandy', type: 'human' },\n    { name: 'Albus', type: 'dawg' }\n]\n\nWe'll use filter in a point style to only get the humans:\nconst filterHumans = people =>\n    filter(\n        person => getOr('unknown', 'type', person) === 'human',\n        people\n    )\n\nRunning it against the party, we get:\nconsole.log(filterHumans(party))\n// [ { name: 'Jesse', type: 'human' },\n//   { name: 'Brandy', type: 'human' } ]\n\nIf we rewrote that in point-free style, we could remove the people parameter because filter is already curried by default, and expects the Array as the 2nd parameter:\nconst filterHumans =\n    filter(\n        person => getOr('unknown', 'type', person) === 'human'\n    )\n\nWe can't further make it point-free without creating some additional pure functions, namely the predicate we pass to filter. Let's shrink getOr to be point-free first:\n// from\nconst getTypeOrUnknown = person => getOr('unknown', 'type', person)\n// to\nconst getTypeOrUnknown = getOr('unknown', 'type')\n\nNow we can put that into our filter:\nconst getTypeOrUnknown = getOr('unknown', 'type')\nconst filterHumans =\n    filter(\n        person => getTypeOrUnknown(person) === 'human'\n    )\n\nisEqual\nAlmost all operators in JavaScript have equivalent pure function versions of them in lodash/fp. Operators work well and should not be avoided, but they do not compose as well as functions do. The isEqual is like ===, just a function. We can replace the thing === 'human' with isEqual:\n// point style\nconst equalsHuman = thing => isEqual('human', thing)\n\n// point-free style\nconst equalsHuman = isEqual('human')\n\nUsing that in our filter:\nconst getTypeOrUnknown = getOr('unknown', 'type')\nconst equalsHuman = isEqual('human')\nconst filterHumans =\n    filter(\n        person => equalsHuman(getTypeOrUnknown(person))\n    )\n\nGreat, one function left.\nFlow\nHowever, you see the nesting up there? The equalsHuman(getTypeOrUnknown(person)) part. Once you have 2 or more functions nested like this, you can break them into a line using flow. It allows you to compose functions into a chain or set of pipes, just like Promises do, but synchronously. Don't worry if this is hard to grok, we've devoted an entire section to flow in composing functions in this chapter.\nTo make the filter predicate point-free, we have to remove that person parameter. The only way to do that is to write a function that wraps equalsHuman and getTypeOrUnknown:\nconst isHuman = person => equalsHuman(getTypeOrUnknown(person))\n\n... but he isn't point-free. Let's use flow:\nconst isHuman = person => flow([getTypeOrUnknown, equalsHuman])(person)\n\nAnd then the point-free version:\nconst isHuman = flow([getTypeOrUnknown, equalsHuman])\n\nNow, using that in our filter to make all of it point-free:\nconst getTypeOrUnknown = getOr('unknown', 'type')\nconst equalsHuman = isEqual('human')\nconst isHuman = flow([getTypeOrUnknown, equalsHuman])\nconst filterHumans = filter(isHuman)\n\nConclusions\nPoint-free style can significantly reduce the amount of code you have to write, and often happens when you use a lot of partial applications. The cost is increased cognitive load: it makes you think more when reading it. Most of what we you do as a programmer is read code, not write it. That's why some people call point-free programming \"pointless programming\".\n"},"part6/":{"url":"part6/","title":"Part 6: Algebraic Data Types","keywords":"","body":"Algebraic Data Types\nAlgebraic Data Types are Objects in Functional Programming that give you a common interfaces to work with data. While I promised I wouldn't cover Category Theory in this book, it does hold one compelling reason to learn Functional Programming:\n\nWhat if everything had the same interface?\n\nWhile dynamic programming languages don't have strong typing, they still have native types like Array and Promise that hold data and have conventions on how you use them. An Array is a list, I can add data to it, get data out using numbers or methods, and construction methods like Array destructuring [...original, \"new data to add\"]. Promise also wraps data in itself, you can get data out using then, and like Array, you can chain Promises together by returning a Promise in the then callback.\nAlgebraic Data Types, or ADT's for short, are useful just like Array and Promise are useful: Hold data, you can get data out, and depending on which library you use, all can be chained together in known ways.\nThis is also where dynamic languages start to become painful. Creating an Array or Promise is fine, but once you start chaining things together, it's hard to know \"what comes out\" without a compiler or intellisense in your IDE to help you. Algebraic Data Types have this problem as well once you start composing them together. You only really know if it works by running the code. Still, they can add clarity of intent, help in data validation, and make it easier to work with data and errors.\n"},"part6/maybe.html":{"url":"part6/maybe.html","title":"Maybe","keywords":"","body":"[jwarden 1.8.2019] TODO: Remove some of the chaining stuff perhaps? A lot of examples, not sure the value of multiple... maybe need to sleep (again) on it.\nAlso, need to show how we can compose using Maybe to make better pipelines... probably belongs in a separate section.\nMaybe\nA Maybe is a data type that represents data either being there or not. It's used a lot when you are getting data from effects; loading data from a server, reading from a text file, or environment variables. It can also be used when you're asking for data that might not be there such as searching Array's or keys in Objects. We've covered get in Part 3: get and getOr in [Part 5: Tacit Programming]. They are similar to a Maybe in practice; maybe this Object exists and has this property, and it isn't undefined... maybe not. Where get and getOr are functions that return data, Maybe is a type that holds data.\nLet's import get from lodash/fp and Maybe from Folktale to compare them. Here we have a config.json that has a serverURL property. \nconst { get } = require('lodash/fp')\nconst Maybe = require('folktale/maybe')\n\n// { \"serverURL\": \"http://cow.com\" }\nconst configFile = require('./config.json')\nconsole.log(\"configFile:\", configFile)\n\nThe get will attempt to read the \"serverURL\" property from the parsed JSON:\n// get\nconst getServerURL = () =>\n    get('serverURL', configFile)\n\nconsole.log(getServerURL())/\n// http://cow.com\n\nThe Maybe just holds the response... in a Just:\n// Maybe\nconst serverURLMaybe = () =>\n    get('serverURL', configFile)\n    ? Maybe.Just(get('serverURL', configFile))\n    : Maybe.Nothing()\n\nconsole.log(serverURLMaybe())\n// folktale:Maybe.Just({ value: \"http://cow.com\" })\n\nWhen we attempt to read the \"pingURL\", a non-existent property in the JSON using get, we'll get undefined:\nconst getPingURL = () =>\n    get('pingURL', configFile)\n\nconsole.log(getPingURL())\n// undefined\n\nWhen we do the same with Maybe, we get back a Nothing:\nconst getPingURLMaybe = () =>\n    get('pingURL', configFile)\n    ? Maybe.Just(get('pingURL', configFile))\n    : Maybe.Nothing()\n\nconsole.log(getPingURLMaybe())\n// folktale:Maybe.Nothing({  })\n\nEasier Usage\nA lot of types have sub-types, so if we destructure those, it's a bit easier to read once you've memorized the API.\nconst { Just, Nothing } = Maybe\n\nconst getPingURLMaybe = () =>\n    get('pingURL', configFile)\n    ? Just(get('pingURL', configFile))\n    : Nothing()\n\nconsole.log(getPingURLMaybe())\n// folktale:Maybe.Nothing({  })\n\nGetting Data Out\nThere are two ways in Folktale, getOrElse and value, but value isn't really a public function so use at your own risk (or for debbugging only). The getOrElse works like getOr; either give me the value, else if it's undefined or null, give me the default I provide.\nconst maybeServerURL = Just('http://cow.com')\nconst serverURL = maybeServerURL.getOrElse('http://localhost:8080')\nconsole.log(serverURL) // http://cow.com\n\nconst maybePingURL = Nothing()\nconst pingURL = maybePingURL.getOrElse('http://localhost:3000/ping')\nconsole.log(pingURL) // http://localhost:3000/ping\n\nChaining Maybes\nA Promise chain with a bunch of thens will continue modifying the data until the last then. A flow/compose chain will do the same thing. What a Promise chain, and a Maybe chain, have in common, however, is the abort concept. If any one of the Promises error, all the subsequent then's aren't run, and the catch is fired with what rejected the chain. Maybe is similiar in that all returned Just's will continue, but a returned Nothing will abort the chain.\nHere's a chain of Promises that modify data on down the line:\nPromise.resolve('warden jesse')\n.then(name => Promise.reject(new Error('b00m b00m')))\n.then(name => name.reverse())\n.then(name => startCase(name))\n.then(name => console.log(\"name:\", name))\n.catch(boom => console.log(\"boom:\", boom))\n// Jesse Warden\n\nThe same chain, but with an error in the first then:\nPromise.resolve('warden jesse')\n.then(name => Promise.reject(new Error('b00m b00m')))\n.then(name => name.reverse())\n.then(name => startCase(name))\n.then(name => console.log(\"name:\", name))\n.catch(boom => console.log(\"boom:\", boom))\n// boom: Error: b00m b00m\n\nMaybe's can be chained in a similar way:\nconsole.log(\n    Just('warden jesse')\n    .chain(name => Just(name.split(' ')))\n    .chain(name => Just(name.reverse()))\n    .chain(name => Just(startCase(name)))\n    .getOrElse('parsing failed, brah')\n)\n// Jesse Warden\n\nAnd a Nothing will abort the chain, just like a rejected Promise will abort a Promise chain:\n\nconsole.log(\n    Just('warden jesse')\n    .chain(name => Nothing())\n    .chain(name => Just(name.reverse()))\n    .chain(name => Just(startCase(name)))\n    .getOrElse('parsing failed, brah')\n)\n// parsing failed, brah\n\nJust remember to return a Maybe to keep the chain going. A Promise is flexible in that you can return any value or a Promise; it supports both whereas chain only supports returning a Maybe.\nChanging The Value\nYou can also change the value instead using map which works like an Array's map:\nconsole.log(\n    Just('warden jesse')\n    .map(name => name.split(' '))\n    .map(name => name.reverse())\n    .map(name => startCase(name))\n    .getOrElse('parsing failed, brah')\n)\n// Jesse Warden\n\nJust be aware it is mapping the value, so it doesn't handle errors, or handle Nothing... it's just a map:\nconsole.log(\n    Just('warden jesse')\n    .map(name => Nothing()) // Nothing doesn't have a reverse method...\n    .map(name => name.reverse())\n    .map(name => startCase(name))\n    .getOrElse('parsing failed, brah')\n)\n// TypeError: name.reverse is not a function\n\nError Handling\nYou can use Maybe's to represent data that might work. However, instead of getting a default value, you may want to run a function, just like you do in a Promise's catch function. You can use orElse.\nIt's ignored if it succeeds with a Just:\nconsole.log(\n    Just('warden jesse')\n    .chain(name => Just(name.split(' ')))\n    .chain(name => Just(name.reverse()))\n    .chain(name => Just(startCase(name)))\n    .orElse(() => {\n        console.log('Parsing failed.')\n        return false\n    })\n)\n// folktale:Maybe.Just({ value: \"Jesse Warden\" })\n\nIf any return a Nothing, it'll fire the orElse:\nconsole.log(\n    Just('warden jesse')\n    .chain(name => Just(name.split(' ')))\n    .chain(name => Just(name.reverse()))\n    .chain(name => Just(startCase(name)))\n    .orElse(() => {\n        console.log('Parsing failed.')\n        return false\n    })\n)\n// false\n\nPattern Matching\nIf you want to react to both, you can use Pattern Matching via matchWith. It's a flexible function, acting like an if/else, and you can return whatever you want from the matcher Object you pass in, and you can ignore the value passed in from the Just as well:\nconst maybeCow = Just('cow')\nconst result = maybeCow.matchWith({\n    Just: ( { value } ) => `We have a value: ${value}`,\n    Nothing: () => 'No cow... sadness.'\n})\nconsole.log(result)\n// We have a value: cow\n\nconst hopefullyNotNothing = Nothing()\nconst ohNo = hopefullyNotNothing.matchWith({\n    Just: () => `Dark sequel, man...`,\n    Nothing: () => 'Say my name, Bastion!'\n})\nconsole.log(ohNo)\n// Say my name, Bastion!\n\nYou can end cap your long chains for Just:\nconsole.log(\n    Just('warden jesse')\n    .chain(name => Just(name.split(' ')))\n    .chain(name => Just(name.reverse()))\n    .chain(name => Just(startCase(name)))\n    .matchWith({\n        Just: ({value}) => `Parse result: ${value}`,\n        Nothing: () => 'Parsing failed.'\n    })\n)\n// Parse result: Jesse Warden\n\n... as well as long chains for Nothing:\nconsole.log(\n    Just('warden jesse')\n    .chain(name => Nothing())\n    .chain(name => Just(name.reverse()))\n    .chain(name => Just(startCase(name)))\n    .matchWith({\n        Just: ({value}) => `Parse result: ${value}`,\n        Nothing: () => 'Parsing failed.'\n    })\n)\n// Parsing failed.\n\nConclusions\nWhenever you are getting data from an outside source of your code like servers, files, and environment variables, Maybe is a great return value choice. When calling functions that may not have the data you're looking for, like looking in Array's or for specific key/values in Objects, Maybe is a much safer, and easier to work with return value, than undefined, null, or -1.

It's basically an Array with some helpful methods. This is my favorite Algebraic Data Type, mainly because it was one of my gateways to Fuctional Programming, and another gateway to Total Functions (we'll cover those in the next Chapter, Part 7: Total Functions). More importantly, it can tell you all the things that went wrong with a function in excruciating detail. When you start composing large programs together, it is what negates the need for interpreting the stack trace; you just read the validation errors to see what happened.\nYou use Validations to validate data.

Success(member)\n    : Failure([`${member.name} is not healthy.`])\n\nconsole.log(isHealthy(jesse))\n// folktale:Validation.Failure({ value: [\"Jesse Warden is not healthy.\"] })\n\nconsole.log(isHealthy(brandy))\n// folktale:Validation.Success({ value: { name: \"Brandy Fortune\", clazz: \"Cleric\", hitPoints: 11, maxHitPoints: 11 } })\n\nAdding Success and Failure\nLike Maybe, the Validation has 2 sub-types, Success and Failure. They each hold 2 types of data. Success holds the data you're validation. Failure holds a list of validation errors, typically strings. If the data you're validating has 3 errors, the Array inside the Failure will have 3 String items.\nUnlike Maybe, you can add these types together. It's similar to an Array concat method:\nlet errors = []\nerrors = errors.concat(['Not healthy.'])\nerrors = errors.concat(['Not a healer.'])\n\nconsole.log(errors)\n// [ 'Not healthy.', 'Not a healer.' ]\n\nWhen you're running data validation, you're typically running a bunch of checks, not just one like the example of above. Like every, if all pass, it's considered a Success. If even just 1 fails, it's a Failure, and it will include only that failure in the Array.\nAdding Success to Success always breeds Success when cows are involved:\nconst good = Success('üêÆ')\n.concat(Success('üêÑ'))\n.concat(Success('üêÑ'))\n.concat(Success('üêÆ'))\n// folktale:Validation.Success({ value: \"üêÆ\" })\n\nHowever, adding a Failure to a Success always ends up in Failure:\nconst bad = Success('üê•')\n.concat(Failure([`Wait, he's not a cow.`]))\n\nconsole.log(bad)\n// folktale:Validation.Failure({ value: [\"Wait, he's not a cow.\"] })\n\nFor every Failure you add, they'll be merged together:\nconst onlyTheErrorsMam = Success('üêÆ')\n.concat(Failure([`The wave function collapsed.`]))\n.concat(Success('üêÑ`))\n.concat(Failure([`Dude, seriously, there is no Shannon, this bartender has been yelling her name for an hour, super loud.`]))\n\nconsole.log(onlyTheErrorsMam)\n// folktale:Validation.Failure({ value: [\n//     \"The wave function collapsed.\", \n//     \"Dude, seriously, there is no Shannon, this bartender has been yelling her name for an hour, super loud.\"] \n// })\n\nCombining Validations\nTypically you'll make functions that validate some data, and then combine them together:\nconst isCleric = member =>\n    (member.clazz === 'Cleric')\n    ? Success(member)\n    : Failure([`${member.name} is not a Cleric, they're a ${member.clazz}.`])\n\nconst isHealthyHealer = member =>\n    isHealthy(member)\n    .concat(isCleric(member))\n\nconsole.log(isHealthyHealer(jesse))\n// folktale:Validation.Failure({ value: [\n//     \"Jesse Warden is not healthy.\", \n//     \"Jesse Warden is not a Cleric, they're a Swashbuckler.\"\n// ] })\n\nconsole.log(isHealthyHealer(brandy))\n// folktale:Validation.Success({ value: { name: \"Brandy Fortune\", clazz: \"Cleric\", hitPoints: 11, maxHitPoints: 11 } })\n\nIn the above, Jesse is neither healthy, nor is his class a Cleric, so both validation errors are included. Brandy is both healthy and a Cleric, so her validation result is successful.\nPattern Matching\nLike Maybe, you can pattern match the Validation using matchWith. For Success, the value will be whatever you passed in, and for Failure, it's the Array of validation errors you made (typically an Array of Strings):\nconst isHealthyHealer = member =>\n    isHealthy(member)\n    .concat(isCleric(member))\n    .matchWith({\n        Success: ( { value } ) => true,\n        Failure: ({ value } ) => false\n    })\n\nconsole.log(isHealthyHealer(jesse)) // false\nconsole.log(isHealthyHealer(brandy)) // true\n\nConclusions\nValidations are great for validating data and knowing exactly why it failed. When you're sanitizing your inputs in your API, you can provide wonderful feedback to yourself for debuggin, and in your error messages to developers. For front-end development, it's a wonderful way to validate form fields, and to provide a lot of helpful error messages to users. For both, be as verbose as possible in the Failure to help debug validation later so there is no ambiguity why it failed.

Good thing I didn't say I was Shannon.\n"},"part6/result.html":{"url":"part6/result.html","title":"Result","keywords":"","body":"Result\nA Result is a data type for modeling errors. Unlike try/catch and throw, it can give you more control on progating those errors in a pure way. When in doubt, if it's async and it can fail, use Promise. If it's sync and it can fail, use Result.\nconst Result = require('folktale/result')\nconst { Ok, Error } = Result\nconst fs = require('fs')\n\n// async\nconst readFile = file =>\n    new Promise((success, failure) =>\n        fs.readFile(file, (err, data) =>\n            err\n            ? failure(err)\n            : success(data)\n        )\n    )\n\nreadFile('non-existent-file.cow')\n.then(contents => console.log(\"contents:\", contents))\n.catch(error => console.log(\"file read error:\", error))\n// file read error: { Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open 'non-existent-file.cow'\n\n// sync\nconst readFileSync = file => {\n    try {\n        const data = fs.readFileSync(file)\n        return Ok(data)\n    } catch(readError) {\n        return Error(readError.message)\n    }\n}\n\nconst result = readFileSync('non-existent-file.cow')\n// result: folktale:Result.Error({ value: \"ENOENT: no such file or directory, open 'non-existent-file.cow'\" })\n\nOk and Error\nThe two sub-types of Result are Ok and Error. Ok means whatever you were doing worked, and Ok will contain the data. It could also just mean \"things didn't blow up\".\nThe Error contain what went wrong. This can be any data type you want. If it's one thing, a String is usually best. If you don't know, the original native Error is better. If you decide to create a custom one, be careful of name collisions. Destructuring Error leads to confusion when you start going new Error('t3h failurez') and get back a Folktale Result folktale:Result.Error({ value: \"t3h failurez\" }) instead of what you thought, a native error with stack trace included Error: t3h failurez.\nWhen many things can go wrong, its better to use a Union Type (see next section, Part 6: Union Types).\nChi Chi Chain Chain\nLike Promise and Maybe, you can chain Result. The chain method works like the others; good things like Ok will continue the chain. As soon as an Result.Error is returned, the whole chain is aborted.\nBelow, everything is fine:\nconst Result = require('folktale/result')\nconst { Ok, Error } = Result\nconst { startCase } = require('lodash/fp')\n\nconst safeSplit = name => {\n    try {\n        const result = name.split(' ')\n        return Ok(result)\n    } catch(error) {\n        return Error(error.message)\n    }\n}\n\nconsole.log(\n    Ok('warden jesse')\n    .chain(name => safeSplit(name))\n    .chain(name => Ok(name.reverse()))\n    .chain(name => Ok(startCase(name)))\n)\n// folktale:Result.Ok({ value: \"Jesse Warden\" })\n\nHowever, if we inject bad data at the beginning:\nconsole.log(\n    Ok(undefined)\n    .chain(name => safeSplit(name))\n    .chain(name => Ok(name.reverse()))\n    .chain(name => Ok(startCase(name)))\n)\n// folktale:Result.Error({ value: \"Cannot read property 'split' of undefined\" })\n\nJust like Promise and Maybe; good values will keep chaining, bad ones immediately abort.\nGetting Data Out\nLike Maybe, if there is data in the Ok, you can get it out, else supply a default in case of an Error:\nconst castSpellResult = Error('Failed, not enough mana.')\nconst didSpellWork = castSpellResult.getOrElse('Spell casting failed.')\n\nconsole.log(didSpellWork)\n// Spell casting failed\n\nconst attackResult = Ok('Success, 4 points of damage!')\nconst didAttackWork = attackResult.getOrElse('Attack failed.')\nconsole.log(didAttackWork)\n// Success, 4 points of damage!\n\nPattern Matching\nLike Maybe and Validator, you can use matchWith to pattern match on the Result:\nconst attackResult = Ok( { hit: true, attacker: 'Jesse', target: 'Bad Guy', weapon: 'Boomerang' } )\nconst printedResult = attackResult.matchWith({\n    Ok: ( { value } ) =>\n        value.hit\n        ? `${value.attacker} successfully hit ${value.target} with ${value.weapon}!`\n        : `${value.attacker} missed ${value.target} with ${value.weapon}...`\n})\n\nconsole.log(printedResult)\n// Jesse successfully hit Bad Guy with Boomerang!\n\ntry\nJust like using promisify became a habit to more easily wrap callback methods to return a Promise instead, so too is it common to wrap methods that can throw errors with Result using Result.try:\nconst result = Result.try(() => JSON.parse(undefined))\n\nconsole.log(result)\n// folktale:Result.Error({ value: SyntaxError: Unexpected token u in JSON at position 0 })\n\nConclusions\nUse Result when something can go wrong, typically a native Error is thrown, or a bunch of things can go wrong. When it's ok, like an Array not having your data, or an environment variable not being set, use a Maybe. If you need to know a series of Errors, Validation is probably better. Learn more from the Folktale Result documentation. \n"},"part6/union.html":{"url":"part6/union.html","title":"Union","keywords":"","body":"Union\nA Union is a bunch of types in one value. You use them to represent many possible types. They're also a great replacement for one or many Booleans. Union types have a special ability called matching that uses a pure function and removes the need for using if statements. You've seen this briefly used in the Validation and Result sections and we'll expound on it here.\nScalars, Products, and Unions\nA String  is a scalar type; \"cow\" is always \"cow\" and completely different from \"goat\".\nAn Object is a product type; it's the combination of many types into one like:\n{ name: 'Dat Moo Moo', age: 2, type: 'üêÆ', food: ['hay', 'grass'] }\n\nThat Object contains 2 Strings, a Number, and an Array.\nA union type combines those products together. If you've read this book in order, you've already seen 3 Union types: Maybe, Validation and Result. A Maybe is either a Just or Nothing. Both are distinct types like Array, and they have similar methods, but represent completely different things. The Maybe marries the 2 into 1 type.\nconst union = require('folktale/adt/union/union')\n\nconst Maybe = union('Maybe', {\n    Just( value ) { return { value } }\n    Nothing() {}\n})\n\nBasic Custom Example\nBelow, we're searching a list of users by ID. If we find one, we want the user it found. If it didn't find one, we want a clear message saying so, and what ID we used to search for:\nconst { find } = require('lodash/fp')\nconst { union, derivations} = require('folktale/adt/union')\n\nconst FindUserResult = union('FindUserResult', {\n    User(user) { return { user } },\n    IDNotFound(userID) { return { userID } }\n}).derive(derivations.debugRepresentation)\n\nconst { User, IDNotFound } = FindUserResult\n\nconst findUserByID = (users, userID) =>\n    find(\n        user => user.id === userID,\n        users\n    )\n\nconst findUser = (users, userID) =>\n    findUserByID(users, userID)\n    ? User(findUserByID(users, userID))\n    : IDNotFound(userID)\n\nconst users = [\n    { name: 'Jesse', id: 1 },\n    { name: 'Brandy', id: 2 }\n]\n\nconst result1 = findUser(users, 2)\nconsole.log(result1)\n// FindUserResult.User({ user: { name: \"Brandy\", id: 2 } })\n\nconst result2 = findUser(users, 5)\nconsole.log(result2)\n// FindUserResult.IDNotFound({ userID: 5 })\n\nSimilar to Maybe, just more specific. Note the .derive(derivations.debugRepresentation) is so when we console.log it out, it doesn't just print as a normal looking Object.\nMore Than 2\nHowever, not all sub-types have to have 2 like Maybe, Validation, Result, and FindUserResult:\nFor example, if you're using Kafka or Amazon Kinesis to build a log monitoring application, you'll often be a stream processor. You'll listen to a series of input streams, parse and aggregate the data, and then output it on another stream. Given it's from a multitude of applications, you'll be getting many different types of messages, and each one contains different information, and in turn requires a separate parsing operation.\nconst Message = union('Message', {\n    Log(log) { return { log } },\n    DatadogMetric(metric) { return { metric } },\n    ManualAlert(alert) { return { alert } },\n    NetworkInfo(source, info) { return { source, info } }\n})\n\nWhat Could Possibly Go Wrong?\nUnion types are great for modeling errors. They help you know more clearly what went wrong, embed debug information for future you, while keeping things pure and composable.\nFor example, if you want to upload an Excel file in this application we built at work, there are a lot of things to go wrong. You wouldn't know that, though, from reading this code:\nconst uploadFile = request => form =>\n    new Promise((success, failure) =>\n        request.post('/upload', {form}, (err, res, data) =>\n            err\n            ? failure(err)\n            : success(data)\n    )\n\nIf you give it a request and some multi-part form data, she'll attempt to upload. If it works, great, you'll get the server response in the Promise.then. If it fails, you'll get an what went wrong in the Promise.catch. Cool right?\nWell, no. This is an application for users who aren't always tech savvy and manage a lot of money. Any visual indication as to what went wrong can help in customer support calls and various escalations to higher level support, like the developers who wrote the code. If the developers use good error handling and the designer on the team creates a good error screen with well written copy, the developers hopefully won't ever get a support call. Additionally, any information a user might do to help fix the problem themselves can stop those calls from even happening.\nSo what can go wrong? There are known knowns, and known unknowns:\n\nyour session can expire if you login and leave the web application open for 20 minutes without doing anything. Either the http status is 302, OR it's 200 but the URL is not the URL you posted too because you have a proxy in front of your API layer that makes strange decisions.\nwe can't figure out who you are from the session\nyou attempt to upload a file that isn't an Excel file\nyou attempt to upload an Excel file that has macros in it\nyou attempt to upload a virus\nyou upload more than 1 file, and the first file is fine, but the other one(s) have 1 of the problems listed above\nthe email took too long to send a successful email response or failed\nthe messaging service that lets you know the status of your file either failed or couldn't be reached in time\n\nLet's model that into a custom Union type:\nconst FileUploadResult = union('FileUploadResult', {\n    SessionExpired(error, httpStatusCode) { return { error, httpStatusCode } },\n    NotLoggedIn(error, httpStatusCode) { return { error, httpStatusCode } },\n    UnsupportedFileType(error, file, reason) { return { error, file, reason } },\n    ExcelMacros(error, file, reason) { return { error, file, reason } },\n    Virus(error, file, reason) { return { error, file, reason } },\n    EmailFailed(error, file) { return { error, file } },\n    MessageFailed(error) { return { error} }\n    Success(file) { return { file } }\n})\n\nNotice all are errors, and many hold more information about the error, like the http status code vs. just looking around in the message String. The last one indicates a successful file upload and contains the file it uploaded.\nNow that we have our type, we can use it to be more clear as to what went wrong or right by returning that from the Promise. We won't ever fail the Promise, though, we'll just let the caller decide, so we remove the typically success/failure, and just put resolve: \nconst uploadFile = request => form =>\n    new Promise(resolve =>\n        request.post('/upload', {form}, (err, res, data) =>\n            resolve(getFileUploadResult(err, res, data))\n    )\n)\n\nCalling it, we can build up String for each error to be clear what went wrong or right:\nconst uploadResult = await uploadFile(require('request'))(fileForm)\n\nuploadResult.matchWith({\n    SessionExpired: ({error, httpStatusCode}) =>\n        `You've been logged out. http code: ${httpStatusCode}, error: ${error.message}`,\n    NotLoggedIn: _ => window.location.reload(true), // let Proxy redirect to login\n    UnsupportedFileType: ({ error, file, reason }) =>\n        `An unsupported file type was uploaded. We only support Excel files with no macros.\nfile: ${file}`,\n    ExcelMacros: ({ file }) =>\n        `The Excel file you uploaded contained macros. Please remove them and Save As to create a new Excel with the macros removed.\nFile: ${file}`,\n    Virus: ({ file }) =>\n        `The Excel file you uploaded was identified as a virus.\nvirus file: ${file}`,\n    EmailFailed: ({ error }) =>\n        `We failed to email your file successful. Error received: ${error}`,\n    MessageFailed: _ =>\n        `We emailed your file successfully, but failed to send a confirmation message. Please manually check your inbox.`,\n    Success: ({ file }) =>\n        `Successfully uploaded and emailed your file: ${file}`\n})\n\nDid it Work or Not?\nIf you just want to know if it worked or not, you can simply return a Boolean. The stubTrue and stubFalse functions from lodash & lodash/fp are functions that always return true () => true, and always return false () => false:\nconst { stubTrue, stubFalse } = \nconst didUploadWork = result => result.matchWith({\n    SessionExpired: stubFalse,\n    NotLoggedIn: stubFalse,\n    UnsupportedFileType: stubFalse,\n    ExcelMacros: stubFalse,\n    Virus: stubFalse,\n    EmailFailed: stubFalse,\n    MessageFailed: stubFalse,\n    Success: stubTrue\n})\n\nconsole.log(didUploadWork(Success('some file'))) // true\nconsole.log(didUploadWork(NotLoggedIn(new Error('boom', 400)))) // false\n\nmatchWith vs. Type Checking\nThis style of wrapping complex return values into custom types is used in Object Oriented Programming as well. For exmaple, simplifying a fetch call into 3 possible return values/\nWe got an HTTP status other than 200:\nclass Failed {\n    constructor(error) {\n        this.error = error\n    }\n}\n\nWe got a good response, but couldn't parse the JSON:\nclass JSONParseFailed {\n    constructor(error) {\n        this.error = error\n    }\n}\n\nAnd a successful response with successful JSON parsing:\nclass Successful {\n    constructor(data) {\n        this.data = data\n    }\n}\n\nYou'd then check the type:\nsomeFetchCall()\n.then(result => {\n    if(result instanceof Failed) {\n        error(\"HTTP call failed:\", result.error)\n        return result.error\n    } else if(result instanceof JSONParseFailed) {\n        error(\"JSON parsing failed:\", result.error)\n        return result.error\n    } else {\n        log(\"Successful:\", result.data)\n        return result.data\n    }\n})\n\nRanting about the problems with if statements ecspecially without a type system is beyond the scope of this book, so suffice to say:\n\nwe're not checking specifically for Successful, we just assume if the first too aren't found, it's Successful.\nIf we were missing a type, we'd get a null pointer on result.data trying to access data on a class type that doesn't have it... not really helpful to say why the fetch call did or did not succeed.\nIf we add/remove a type, we have to be careful about ensuring the order of if statements and ensure each case is handled.\nWhat do we put for the else if we did specifically check for Successful?\nWe're having to dot access class instances without lenses nor a type checker.\nYou could accidentally forget to return a specific/correct value from the class error / data property.\nThis is Imperative style code in a Functional Programming book, GTFO.\n\nLet's change that to a pure function using matchWith and Union a type instead. We'll first define are types like we did in the OOP example:\nconst FetchResult = union('FetchResult', {\n    Failed(error) { return { error } }\n    , JSONParseFailed(error) { return { error } }\n    , Successful(data) { return { data } }\n})\n\nAnd to use it, we just use matchWith:\nsomeFetchCall()\n.then(result =>\n    result.matchWith({\n        Failed: error =>\n            error(\"HTTP call failed:\", error)\n        , JSONParseFailed: error =>\n            error(\"JSON parsing failed:\", error)\n        , Successful: data =>\n            log(\"data:\", data)\n    })\n})\n\nIf you're not using a typed language like TypeScript or Flow, you can ensure you covered all possible cases with an any.\nconst { any } = require('folktale/adt/union/union')\n\nsomeFetchCall()\n.then(result =>\n    result.matchWith({\n        ...\n        , [any]: () =>\n            error(\"unknown match.\") // might not be error\n    })\n})\n\nRemember, matchWith is a pure function. If you're forced to work with Promises, you can simply return the unboxed values, and the data will go to the then and the error's will automatically go to the catch:\n...\n.then(result =>\n    result.matchWith({\n        Failed: error =>\n            error(\"HTTP call failed:\", error) || error\n        , JSONParseFailed: error =>\n            error(\"JSON parsing failed:\", error) || error\n        , Successful: data =>\n            log(\"data:\", data) || data\n    })\n})\n\nWhile I'm not a fan, many love the await/async syntax. If you use Union types as the return value instead of values or Error's like you do with Promises, you can solve 2 problems:\n\nno need for a try/catch\nallow the consumer to pattern match the result\n\nconst result = await someFetchCall()\nconst data = result.matchWith({\n    ...\n})\n\nBoolean Replacements\nJeremy Fairbank covers the problem with Boolean's is his presentation \"Solving the Boolean Identity Crisis\". The short version is using Booleans, even outside of a type system can cause problems with if statements missing a case, and parameters not really being clear as to what they mean. We'll cover the latter problem.\nFor example, this function call from a game:\njump(true)\n\nIs the true meaning \"how high\" or \"using gravity boots to stick on the celing\" or.... what? No clue, so you go read the function definition to figure it out.\n... vs this one:\njump(Horizontal)\n\nSuddenly it's more clear just by reading the function the first parameter means a horizontal jump vs a vertical one.\nBefore types, you have to check the Boolean value with an if statement:\nconst jump = horizontal => {\n    if(horizontal === false) { // vertical jump\n        object.applyForce( 0, 2000, object.x, object.y )\n    } else { // horizontal jump\n        object.applyForce( 4000, 100, object.x, object.y )\n    }\n}\n\nvs. using a Union type:\nconst jump = direction =>\n    direction.matchWith({\n        Vertical: _ =>\n            object.applyForce( 0, 2000, object.x, object.y )\n        , Horizontal: _ =>\n            object.applyForce( 4000, 100, object.x, object.y )\n    })\n\nNo need to worry about adding new types of jumps and missing an if else block:\nconst jump = direction =>\n    direction.matchWith({\n        Vertical: _ =>\n            object.applyForce( 0, 2000, object.x, object.y )\n        , Right: _ =>\n            object.applyForce( 4000, 100, object.x, object.y )\n        , Left: _ =>\n            object.applyForce( -4000, 100, object.x, object.y )\n    })\n\nMultiple Booleans in Asynchronous Redux\nWhether you use sagas or thunks to handle asynchronous calls in Redux in React, the UI portion is probably the same.\n\nLoading...\nSuccessfully got data.\nFailed to get data, here's the error and what you can do about it.\n\nThe typical pattern is to create an Object specifically for that finite state machine that looks like this:\n// loading state\n{\n    loading: true\n    , data: undefined\n    , isError: false\n    , error : undefined\n}\n\nAnd when you successfully got data:\n// success state\n{\n    loading: false\n    , data: { loggedIn: true, user: { firstName: 'Jesse' } }\n    , isError: false\n    , error : undefined\n}\n\nAnd when it fails:\n// error state\n{\n    loading: false\n    , data: undefined\n    , isError: true\n    , error : new Error('500 http status code returned.')\n}\n\nCreating reducer functions for this is pretty straightforward. However, you can prevent worrying about getting in invalid states such as:\n// wait, is this the default?\n{\n    loading: false\n    , data: undefined\n    , isError: false\n    , error : undefined\n}\n\nOr my favorite:\n// \"You are figh-ahd!\"\n// \"At least you bought me lunch.\"\n// \"Guuuuud philosophy... see gud in beehd!\"\n{\n    loading: true\n    , data: { loggedIn : true, user: { firstName: 'Jesse' } }\n    , isError: true\n    , error : new Error('200 http status code returned.')\n}\n\nOnce you start having multiple Booleans, it feels pure and safe having just a few reducer functions ensuring you can't really get into an invalid state. However, it's easier to just use a Union type and not have to worry about it ever happening at all:\nconst LoginState = union('LoginState', {\n    Loading() { return {} }\n    , Failure(error) { return { error } }\n    , Success(user) { return { user } }\n})\n\nNow for login, your reducer goes from this:\nconst loginReducer = (previousState, action) => {\n    switch(action.type) {\n        case 'login':\n            return {...previousState, loading: true, data: undefined, isError: false, error: undefined}\n        case 'loginSuccess':\n            return {...previousState, loading: false, isError: false, data: action.data }\n        case 'loginError':\n            return {...previousState, loading: false, isError: true, error: action.error }\n        default:\n            previousState\n    }\n}\n\nTo this:\nconst loginReducer = (previousState, action) => {\n    switch(action.type) {\n        case 'login':\n            return Loading()\n        case 'loginSuccess':\n            return Success(action.data)\n        case 'loginError':\n            return Failure(action.error)\n        default:\n            previousState\n    }\n}\n\nAnd instead of your imperative JSX render method looking like this:\nrender() {\n    if(this.props.login.loading) {\n        return \n    }\n    if(this.props.login.isError) {\n        return \n    }\n    return \n}\n\nYou can just match against the Union in a more functional way:\nrender => () =>\n    this.props.login.matchWith({\n        Loading: _ => \n        , Failure: error => \n        , Success: user => \n    })\n\nConclusions\nUnion types are great for modeling errors, or when you have multiple return types. They can represent data or null more specifically than a simple Maybe, and give you more insight into what we wrong than a simple Result.Error. They make functions that use Booleans as parameters more readable to other developers without having to read the function body to understand what the Boolean parameter means as the Union litterly has its meaning in its name. That, and no need for if statements which are easy to mess up. For mutiple Booleans where you're making smaller state machines, they can help simplify it and ensure only the states you want are capable of being reached.\n"},"part7/":{"url":"part7/","title":"Part 7: Total Functions","keywords":"","body":"Total Functions\nA total function is a pure function that works with all inputs. They often depend on how the language and operators, like + work. If you create a function that adds numbers, it'll work with a Number, String, Function, some random class, anything! Typically they are a lot easier to make in strongly typed languages because the compiler will ensure your function that adds 2 Numbers never gets a String input, or ensures you use + instead of ++ by accident.\nIn dynamic languages, you have to do a lot more work to validate your inputs and take a whitelist approach to types. Considering that JavaScript, Python, and Lua are communities built largely upon libraries, you can't guarantee that someone will be \nProblem: Adding Random Things\nDynamic languages pass random things everywhere. We attempt to not pass random things when we write code and unit tests, but the dynamism is a double edged sword: power of flexibility, yet bad things happen when you get what you weren't expecting.\nFor example, here's our original pure function:\nconst add = (a, b) => a + b\n\nadd(1, 2) // 3\n\nIt follows all pure function rules of same input, same output, and no side effects.\nHowever, what happens if we add things that aren't numbers?\nadd(new Error('how now brown cow'), { get: 'busy child' })\n// 'Error: how now brown cow[object Object]'\n\nUm, ok... that isn't really helpful. Probably not what the developer wanted, nor expected. Worse, once you start composing this with other functions in flow/compose or Promise, the chain can get corrupted. You may get parsing results or errors that don't make immediate sense with little hint as to where the problem originated. This is when you start longing for stack traces again. \nSolution: Solving With Types\nOne way to solve this is to use types. With just a little metadata added by you the developer, compilers can read and understand your code, and find your errors in nanoseconds. They can even offer fixes, or sometimes automatically fix. TypeScript, an open source language & compiler started by Microsoft and open source, is one such language.\nRewriting our function in TypeScript, we explicitly say \"Yo, this function takes 2 numbers, and returns a number.\" This is enough for the TypeScript compiler, tsc to verify your inputs.\nconst add = ( a: number, b: number) : number => a + b\n\nBefore we can even run the code in TypeScript, we have to compile it to JavaScript. However, instantly, TypeScript shows us an error with our 2nd add:\n\nArgument of type 'Error' is not assignable to prameter of type 'number'.`\n\nIn English, that's:\n\n\"The add function only takes a Number for the first argument, but you are passing an Error. You're not allowed to do that. Change the first parameter to a Number.\"\n\nAs your functions grow in number, size, and you start composing them, it can be really hard to keep track of all the types going around, and ensuring that you're always getting the correct type. If another developer is using your code, will they get a meaningful error if your function chokes on a weird type it wasn't expecting? These kinds of problems types can help like TypeScript, Flow, Elm, and PureScript.\nThe downside here is libraries. Just because you're using a transpilation/compilation solution doesn't mean your consumers are. While you can use TypeScript and publish a library to npm doesn't mean those who install it will be using TypeScript. They could just be using raw JavaScript, or Webpack with just ES6. That said, even a little can help, it just won't make your functions total for everyone.\nSolution: Solving With Manual, Native Runtime Validation\nAnother solution is to do your own runtime type evaluation. If you implement a whitelist, then you only ensure the types you're expecting get through, otherwise you tell the caller of the function it failed, and you give them as much detail about what they passed in so they can have an easier time debugging.\nWithout using any libraries and just raw JavaScript, we'll return our own result following the multiple return value model that Go, Lua, and Python follow (see Part 1: Error Quest):\nconst isNumber = o => typeof o === 'number'\nconst addNumbers = (a, b) =>\n    ( isNumber(a) && isNumber(b) )\n    ? {ok: true, data: a + b}\n    : {ok: false, error: new Error(`Either a or b aren't Numbers. a: ${a}, b: ${b}`)}\n\nThere are some edge cases with our isNumber; 1 and Number(1) will be true, but new Number(1) will be false, but it's \"mostly\" total just like some functions are \"mostly\" pure.\nNow calling it:\nconsole.log(add(1, 2))\n// { ok: true, data: 3 }\n\nconsole.log(add(new Error('how now brown cow'), { get: 'busy child' }))\n// { ok: false,\n//   error: Error: Either a or b aren't Numbers. a: Error: how now brown cow, b: [object Object]\n// ...\n\nNow the function is mostly total. It'll literrly accept ANYTHING and let you know if add worked or not. Where pure functions are dependable to build applications on, total functions are a level above that and nigh unbreakable.\nSolution: Solving With Manual, Folktale Runtime Validation\nThe challenge with the above is that isNumber, while a predicate, isn't very composable when you have a bunch of arguments that are different kinds. Also, some types have multiple rules above them such as product or Union types and so you'll run multiple predicates against them.\nFolktale Validations work great here. Let's take our load website pure function:\nconst loadWebsite = (request, url) =>\n    new Promise((success, failure) =>\n        request.get(url, (err, res, body) =>\n            err\n            ? failure(err)\n            : success({res, body})\n        )\n    )\n\n... and make it total using Folktale Validations. We'll first need a bunch of predicates to ensure our request and url are acceptable types.\nRequest Shape\nLet's ensure our request \"looks the right shape\"; has the expected methods and properties we'd want request to have. If it has those, it's probably a request and the developer/us didn't screw up. We'll rely heavily on Lodash' base predicates. Given request uses Object Oriented Programming, we'll use hasIn to be safe when looking for properties as opposed to has:\nconst { get, hasIn, isFunction } = require('lodash')\n\nconst hasGetFunction = o => isFunction(get(o, 'get'))\nconst hasPostFunction = o => isFunction(get(o, 'post'))\nconst hasInitParams = o => hasIn(o, 'initParams')\n\nURL Shape\nFor our url, we'll ensure she's a String, and looks like a URL:\nconst { ..., isString, some } = require('lodash')\n\nconst legitString = o => isString(o) && o.length > 0\nconst hasHTTP = o => isString(o) && o.toLowerCase().indexOf('http') > -1\nconst hasHTTPS = o => isString(o) && o.toLowerCase().indexOf('https') > -1\nconst hasLocalhost = o => isString(o) && o.toLowerCase().indexOf('localhost') > -1\nconst hasDots = o => isString(o) && o.indexOf('.') > -1\n\nconst legitURL = o =>\n    legitString(o)\n    && some(\n        [\n            hasHTTP,\n            hasHTTPS,\n            hasLocalhost,\n            hasDots\n        ],\n        predicate => predicate(o)\n    )\n\nA quick test of the URL one:\nconsole.log(legitURL('http://jessewarden.com')) // true\nconsole.log(legitURL('https://google.com')) // true\nconsole.log(legitURL('localhost:8080')) // true\nconsole.log(legitURL('192.168.0.1')) // true\nconsole.log(legitURL('chicken pot pie')) // false\n\nRequest Validations\nNow we'll create some Validations that use those predicates for request:\nconst Validation = require('folktale/validation')\nconst { Success, Failure } = Validation\n\nconst validRequestGet = o =>\n    hasGetFunction(o)\n    ? Success(o)\n    : Failure([`Your request doesn't have a get function, you sent: ${o}`])\n\nconst validRequestPost = o =>\n    hasPostFunction(o)\n    ? Success(o)\n    : Failure([`Your request doesn't have a post function, you sent: ${o}`])\n\nconst validRequestInitParams = o =>\n    hasInitParams(o)\n    ? Success(o)\n    : Failure([`Your request doesn't have an initParams function, you sent: ${o}`])\n\nconst validRequest = o =>\n    validRequestGet(o)\n    .concat(validRequestPost(o))\n    .concat(validRequestInitParams(o))\n\nURL Validations\nNow the url:\nconst validURL = o =>\n    legitURL(o)\n    ? Success(o)\n    : Failure([`The URL doesn't appear to be a valid url containing http, https, localhost, or dots for an IP Address. You sent: ${o}`])\n\nCombining it All Together\nCombining those together to make our function total:\nconst loadWebsite = (request, url) =>\n    new Promise((success, failure) =>\n        validRequest(request)\n        .concat(validURL(url))\n        .matchWith({\n            Failure: ({ value }) => failure(new Error(value.join(', '))),\n            Success: _ =>\n                request.get(url, (err, res, body) =>\n                    err\n                    ? failure(err)\n                    : success({res, body})\n                )\n        })\n    )\n\nWhen we call it with good parameters, we get our expected result:\nloadWebsite(require('request'), 'http://jessewarden.com')\n.then( ({ body }) => console.log(body.substring(0, 21)))\n.catch(error => console.log(\"error:\", error))\n// html: \n// \nIf we mess up the url, however:\nloadWebsite(require('request'), 'üêÆ')\n...\n// error: Error: The URL doesn't appear to be a valid url containing http, https, localhost, or dots for an IP Address. You sent: üêÆ\n// ...\n\nSame for giving a bogus request:\nconst r = require('request').get\nloadWebsite(r, 'http://jessewarden.com')\n...\n// error: Error: Your request doesn't have a get function, you sent: function (uri, options, callback) {\n//     var params = initParams(uri, options, callback)\n//     params.method = method\n//     return request(params, params.callback)\n//   }, Your request doesn't have a post function, you sent: function (uri, options, callback) {\n//     var params = initParams(uri, options, callback)\n//     params.method = method\n//     return request(params, params.callback)\n//   }, Your request doesn't have an initParams function, you sent: function (uri, options, callback) {\n//     var params = initParams(uri, options, callback)\n//     params.method = method\n//     return request(params, params.callback)\n//   }\n//   ...\n\nYou can see you can now pass whatever you want, and only the good gets through. Instead of relying on 3rd party code and libraries that don't have the best error handling, you only use those errors if bad data somehow makes it passed your total function validations. Anything you can do using Validations to ensure yourself or another developer doesn't have to think when reading an error message is super helpful and time saving. That, and you can avoid strange errors that can occur when third party libraries/code aren't as good as you are in handling various types.\nThe final code is:\n\nconst {isString, some, get, hasIn, isFunction } = require('lodash')\nconst Validation = require('folktale/validation')\nconst { Success, Failure } = Validation\n\n// -- Predicates ---------------------\n\nconst hasGetFunction = o => isFunction(get(o, 'get'))\nconst hasPostFunction = o => isFunction(get(o, 'post'))\nconst hasInitParams = o => hasIn(o, 'initParams')\n\nconst legitString = o => isString(o) && o.length > 0\nconst hasHTTP = o => isString(o) && o.toLowerCase().indexOf('http') > -1\nconst hasHTTPS = o => isString(o) && o.toLowerCase().indexOf('https') > -1\nconst hasLocalhost = o => isString(o) && o.toLowerCase().indexOf('localhost') > -1\nconst hasDots = o => isString(o) && o.indexOf('.') > -1\n\nconst legitURL = o =>\n    legitString(o)\n    && some(\n        [\n            hasHTTP,\n            hasHTTPS,\n            hasLocalhost,\n            hasDots\n        ],\n        predicate => predicate(o)\n    )\n\n// -- Validations ---------------------\n\nconst validRequestGet = o =>\n    hasGetFunction(o)\n    ? Success(o)\n    : Failure([`Your request doesn't have a get function, you sent: ${o}`])\n\nconst validRequestPost = o =>\n    hasPostFunction(o)\n    ? Success(o)\n    : Failure([`Your request doesn't have a post function, you sent: ${o}`])\n\nconst validRequestInitParams = o =>\n    hasInitParams(o)\n    ? Success(o)\n    : Failure([`Your request doesn't have an initParams function, you sent: ${o}`])\n\nconst validRequest = o =>\n    validRequestGet(o)\n    .concat(validRequestPost(o))\n    .concat(validRequestInitParams(o))\n\nconst validURL = o =>\n    legitURL(o)\n    ? Success(o)\n    : Failure([`The URL doesn't appear to be a valid url containing http, https, localhost, or dots for an IP Address. You sent: ${o}`])\n\n\nconst loadWebsite = (request, url) =>\n    new Promise((success, failure) =>\n        validRequest(request)\n        .concat(validURL(url))\n        .matchWith({\n            Failure: ({ value }) => failure(new Error(value.join(', '))),\n            Success: _ =>\n                request.get(url, (err, res, body) =>\n                    err\n                    ? failure(err)\n                    : success({res, body})\n                )\n        })\n    )\n\nUnit Test Side Note\nNote now that we're checking for all 3 methods on request, this may fail unit tests that stub only request with a get function, i.e.:\n// this will fail since stub won't pass validation\nit('request.get should work', () => {\n    const requestStub = {\n        get: (url, callback) => callback(undefined, {}, 'yay')\n    }\n    expect(loadWebsite(requestStub, 'http://jessewarden.com')).to.eventually.be.fulfilled;\n})\n\nConclusions\nTotal functions are pure functions that accept all inputs. The pro's are enhanced error handling if done manually, less unknown errors from other code, and overall more dependable functions. The error messages, especially from API response errors, are really helpful for consumers of your code.\nThe con's are they can require more unit tests to ensure you've handled the edge cases. This is before you even start writing property tests via jsverify. Like unit test stubs, they will expect a certain implementation shape, and so your stubs have to be more thorough to match the implementation. i.e. \"A get is good enough, right? Wait... we're not even testing post, why do I need to implement a blank function for it on the stub?\"\nAlso, developers who are not using types don't like how verbose they are to debug and modify. We've take a 1 line pure function and turned it into 70 lines and 14 additional functions just to make it reasonably total. While you could just unit test the add function itself, you'll end up writing unit tests for the others anyway to ensure you've written your predicates correctly, which in turn leads to a lot of more unit tests. Over time, these tests may not be maintained since it's hard for future developers to understand why the private functions of your module are being so thoroughly tested. \n"},"part8/":{"url":"part8/","title":"Part 8: Optics","keywords":"","body":"Optics\nOptics are a way to build pure functions, called lens functions, that allow you to look at and modify large Objects in an immutable, sometimes total way. In Part 2 we covered basic lenses such as get and set in Lodash, Ramda's lenses via lensPath and view, including Ramda's main Traversal called over.\nIn this chapter we'll introduce you to advanced ways of writing lenses such as Isomorphisms, incorporating total functions into Prisms, and show you how you can combine lenses via composing them into advanced Traversals which are loops that use lenses.\n"},"part8/isomorphisms.html":{"url":"part8/isomorphisms.html","title":"Isomorphisms","keywords":"","body":"Isomorphisms\nIf a thing can change into something different, but then change back, then those two things are isomorphic.\nExamples are JSON. You can have a JSON string that turns into a JSON Object via JSON.parse, but then can turn back into the exact same string again via JSON.stringify. In working with legacy systems such as XML SOAP we'll often convert those large XML structures to JSON, and then back again to XML SOAP. If you're familiar with the Memento Design Pattern, it's kind of like that.\nIf you're building a game and want to save it, you'll typically implement the Memento design pattern to create a small Object that represents the game as it is right now, and then write that to disk as a file, and possibly sync to a cloud server as well. When loading the game, that Object has all the information you need to load the correct level, character stats, and place in the story the player should resume at.\nThe only thing that isn't deterministic about save games is the date they were created. Most games will sort the save games by latest so when you click \"Continue\", it'll load your latest saved game. This includes games that have an Autosave feature. When you save a new game, it'll make that the latest save by updating the date to \"right now\".\nWe can implement this feature as purely as possible using lenses to give you an example of using isomorphisms in practice. Below we'll walk through saving a game and then loading a save game below using the Focused library as it has support for isomorphisms and an easier way to compose lenses together.\nBe aware Focused has 2 ways to use it; using the facade api which is magic af, or the explicit API which looks a lot more like [Ramda]. We'll show both, although the proxy option is one of focused's selling points over Ramda for advanced Optics. Also note most functions in focused are curried by deafult and support the regular function way of calling them (set(lens, value, object)) as well as a single argument per function cal (set(lens)(value)(object)).\nBasic Set\nOur game object looks like so, containing where the player is in the game's story, the map location, x and y tile coordinates, and the current protaganists in the party with their inventory.\nconst gameState = {\n    saveDate: '2018-11-24T18:27:08.950Z',\n    map: 'overworld',\n    chapter: 3,\n    location: { x: 323, y: 422 },\n    characters: [\n        {\n            name: 'Jesse',\n            level: 21,\n            attack: 510,\n            magic: 122,\n            inventory: [\n                {\n                    name: 'Scimitar',\n                    power: 3\n                },\n                {\n                    name: 'Mithral Glove',\n                    defense: 21\n                }\n            ]\n        },\n        {\n            name: 'Brandy',\n            level: 22,\n            attack: 501,\n            magic: 210,\n            inventory: [\n                {\n                    name: 'Green Rod',\n                    magic: 19\n                },\n                {\n                    name: 'White Cape',\n                    defense: 11\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nFirst, we need to import focused's proxy. Like how some developers use Lodash, they'll assign it to an underscore to make it small and easy to use:\nimport { lensProxy } from 'focused'\n\nconst _ = lensProxy()\n\nNext, let's import set to update our Object much like we'd do in Ramda. Notice, however, the use of _ and dotting properties; that is how you create a basic prop or get lens using Focused's proxy api.\nimport { ..., set } from 'focused'\n\nconst updated = set(_.saveDate, new Date(), gameState)\n\nIf we log out updated, you'll see she works just like a set in Lodash and gives you back a new Object with the saveDate to whatever time it is right now:\n{ saveDate: '2018-11-25T18:17:44.214Z',\n  map: 'overworld',\n  chapter: 3,\n  ...\n\nBasic Isomorphism\nHowever, the game object is often read from disk as text. Meaning, you'd have to parse it using JSON.parse:\nimport { readFileSync } from 'fs'\n\nconst savedGameString = readFileSync('savedgame.json')\nconst gameState = JSON.parse(savedGameString)\n\nThen make your changes and convert it back to text using JSON.stringify:\nconst updated = set(_.saveDate, new Date(), gameState)\nconst gameStateString = JSON.stringify(updated)\n\nConverting data back and forth is so common, like map, that Focused has an Isomorphism function called iso:\nconst { ..., iso } = require('focused')\n\nconst jsonISO = iso(JSON.parse, JSON.stringify)\n\nNow, we can collapse those 3 lines of code above to:\nconst savedGameString = readFileSync('savedgame.json')\nconst updatedString = set(_.$(jsonISO).saveDate, new Date(), savedGameString)\n\nLogging out the string, it looks like:\n{ \"saveDate\": \"2018-11-25T18:51:09.227Z\",\n    \"map\": \"overworld\",\n    \"chapter\": 3,\n    ...\n\n"},"part8/prisms.html":{"url":"part8/prisms.html","title":"Prisms","keywords":"","body":"Prisms\nA prism is an isomorphism that is total.

While a Buffer that comes from reading a file, turned into String, then an Object, then back again is also an isomorphism, we need some information about the original Object so we'll just create a custom lens.\nLens Function: Getter\nLike iso, a lens function's first parameter is a getter, and the function's signature is basically a reducer; take in some data as a single parameter, return some transformed data. The readFileSync is straightforward; if you give it a filename, it'll return the contents of that file, hence we just give it the function as the first parameter:\nimport { ..., lens } from 'focused'\n\nconst fileLens = lens(\n    readFileSync,\n    ...\n)\n\nLens Function: Setter\nThe writeFileSync however takes 2 parameters; the filename and contents, yet returns nothing. If we supply a simple wrapper, pre-filling the 1st parameter:\nimport { ..., writeFileSync } from 'fs'\n\nconst fileLens = lens(\n    readFileSync,\n    (data, originalData) => writeFileSync('savedgame.json', data)\n)\n\nBetter, but one problem; the setter part of the lens is supposed to be a reducer and return what it set. Since writeFileSync is mainly about side effects, specifically writing the file, it doesn't return anything and throws if it fails. Very imperative and not what we need. Let's modify it and just return the data you wrote for now. Since writeFileSync always returns undefined, the short circuit || will always return data.\nconst fileLens = iso(\n    readFileSync,\n    (data, originalData) => writeFileSync('savedgame.json', data) || data\n)\n\nComposing Lenses\nInternally, Focused uses its own compose method to combine all the lenses together. Our set:\nset(_.$(jsonISO).saveDate, ...\n\nWithout the proxy syntax could be written as:\nconst { ..., prop, compose } = require('focused')\n\nconst lens = compose(\n    jsonISO,\n    prop('savedDate')\n)\nconst updated = set(lens, new Date(), gameState)\n\nLet's do that so we can combine our fileLens first, then our jsonISO 2nd:\nconst readAndParseLens = compose(\n  fileLens,\n  jsonISO\n)\n\nUsing Our Custom Lens\nAnd we can still keep our proxy syntax with savedDate. Notice we give it the filename instead of the gameState as the 3rd parameter:\nconst updatedString = set(_.$(readAndParseLens).saveDate, new Date(), 'savedgame.json')\n\nLogging out the String:\n{ \"saveDate\": \"2018-11-25T21:24:58.726Z\",\n    \"map\": \"overworld\",\n    \"chapter\": 3,\n    ...\n\nAnd to verify the side effect of writing the file worked, the contents of the file:\n{ \"saveDate\": \"2018-11-25T21:24:58.726Z\",\n    \"map\": \"overworld\",\n    \"chapter\": 3,\n    ...\n\nEnhancing Our Custom Lens\nWhen saving games, you have many saved games. We're using our \"savedgame.json\" as a template, but then writing over it every time. Our custom lens even hardcodes \"savegame.json\" inside of it. What we want is to have a new filename each time we set the saveDate, and have that be part of the filename to make sorting easier and ensure unique filenames.\nMy kids date hack on various games such as Animal Crossing; meaning they manually change the video game console's system clock backwards and forwards so they don't have to wait in the real world. This results in the game rewarding them \"earlier\" than it should, and allowing them to experience special days whenever they want by travelling to the future in game time. This also means using a date as a filename could have collisions, so we'll enhance our lens to use a unique string from a Universal Unique Identifier via the uuid library to prevent those collisions. Date hacking should be allowed and shouldn't result in them accidentally overwriting saved games. Although writing files is a side effect, we'll attempt to keep it as immutable as possible.\nFrom our original lens function:\nconst fileLens = iso(\n    readFileSync,\n    (data, originalData) => writeFileSync('savedgame.json', data) || data\n)\n\nLet's utilize the 2nd parameter of our lens setter, the originalData which is the filename you passed in to read, savedgame.json:\nimport uuidv4 from 'uuid/v4'\n...\n    (data, originalData) => {\n        const filename = \n            originalData\n            .split('.json')\n            .join('')\n        const dataJSON = JSON.parse(data)\n        const newFilename = `${filename}_${dataJSON.saveDate}_${uuidv4()}.json`\n        writeFileSync(newFilename, data)\n        return newFilename\n    }\n...\n\nNice, now each time we run her, we'll get a new filename generated and written to, using our template read-only, even with date hacking:\nconst updatedString = set(_.$(readAndParseLens).saveDate, new Date(), 'savedgame.json')\n// savedgame_2018-11-26T00:21:47.141Z_26ca739b-7e86-4a4d-9363-f63f8e3828e6.json\n\nAnd the data inside:\n{ \"saveDate\": \"2018-11-26T00:21:47.141Z\",\n    \"map\": \"overworld\",\n    \"chapter\": 3,\n    ...\n\n"},"part9/":{"url":"part9/","title":"Part 9: Debugging","keywords":"","body":"Debugging\nDebugging Functional code is a bit different than imperative or Object Oriented code. Your primary means of debugging in imperative and Object Oriented code is exceptions, stack traces, and step debuggers. For functional programming, you often don't have access to the implementation details. That said, you can still use both.\nImperative Debugging\nIn imperative and OOP, you'll have lines of code that you can set breakpoints or logs on to figure out \"what's going on inside\":\nimport { startCase } from 'lodash'\nconst log = console.log\n\nconst fixName = name => {\n    log(\"fixName, name:\", name)\n    const list = name.split(' ')\n    log(\"list:\", list)\n    list[0] = startCase(list[0])\n    log(\"list:\", list)\n    list[1] = startCase(list[1])\n    log(\"list:\", list)\n    const fixedName = `${list[2]}, ${list[0]}`\n    log(\"fixedName:\", fixedName)\n    return fixedName\n}\n\nThere's a bug in the fixName function. We've put a log message on every line. We'll run the code and see where things start to break down.\nfixName, name: jesse warden\nlist: [ 'jesse', 'warden' ]\nlist: [ 'Jesse', 'warden' ]\nlist: [ 'Jesse', 'Warden' ]\nfixedName: undefined, Jesse\nundefined, Jesse\n\nThings were fine until fixedName. The list[2] should be list[1], whoops. If we fix:\n...\n// list[1] was list[2]\nconst fixedName = `${list[1]}, ${list[0]}`\n...\n\n...and re-run:\nfixName, name: jesse warden\nlist: [ 'jesse', 'warden' ]\nlist: [ 'Jesse', 'warden' ]\nlist: [ 'Jesse', 'Warden' ]\nfixedName: Warden, Jesse\nWarden, Jesse\n\nW00t!\nFunctional Debugging: The Cop Out\nLet's do the same thing using a Promise chain:\nconst fixName = name =>\n    Promise.resolve(name)\n    .then(name => name.split(' '))\n    .then(list => [startCase(list[0]), list[1]])\n    .then(list => [list[0], startCase(list[1])])\n    .then(list => `${list[2]}, ${list[0]}`)\n\nAs you start to learn, it's ok to do the cop out; i.e. going back to imperative. The only bad thing about this method is you're changing the function itself by effectively re-writing it. Still, I recommend it to get comfortable writing no {} in your code. It can be a bit of a pain matching up the braces {} and parenthesis () without compiler help as there are cases where you can misplace them and not get errors.\nconst fixName = name =>\n    Promise.resolve(name)\n    .then(name => name.split(' '))\n    .then(list => [startCase(list[0]), list[1]])\n    .then(list => {\n        log(\"list:\", list)\n        return [list[0], startCase(list[1])]\n    })\n    .then(list => `${list[2]}, ${list[0]}`)\n\nFunctional Debugging: Tap\nThe frustration from imperative/OOP coders is \"you can't see what's going on in the pipes\". So you make a tap; a pipe that tells you what's going on inside it.\nconst tap = arg => {\n    console.log(\"tap:\", arg)\n    return arg\n}\n\nTypically, Promises used in chains take 1 argument, just like Result, Maybe, etc. So our function will take the argument, then just return it; the only difference is it logs it. We then insert our logger pipe:\nconst fixName = name =>\n    Promise.resolve(name)\n    .then(tap)\n    .then(name => name.split(' '))\n    .then(tap)\n    .then(list => [startCase(list[0]), list[1]])\n    .then(tap)\n    .then(list => [list[0], startCase(list[1])])\n    .then(tap)\n    .then(list => `${list[2]}, ${list[0]}`)\n    .then(tap)\n\nWhen we run, it looks very similar:\nfixName('jesse warden').then(console.log)\ntap: jesse warden\ntap: [ 'jesse', 'warden' ]\ntap: [ 'Jesse', 'warden' ]\ntap: [ 'Jesse', 'Warden' ]\ntap: undefined, Jesse\nundefined, Jesse\n\nWe can use tap to inspect the pipes without violating pure function rules.\nConclusions\nYou can use cop out if you're in a hurry or just completely confused. Composing functions in a sync and async way is a huge new concept, and imperative code can be very crystal clear about what is happening. You can still use breakpoints if your IDE supports it, just be aware pure functions sometimes don't expose their local variables easily in some IDE's... because they don't have any. There are a variety of taps, as well, especially once you incorporate partial applications to help give you more insight into the different stages of chaining your code is doing.\nconst tap = label => arg => {\n    console.log(`${label}: ${arg}`)\n    return arg\n}\n\nThen we can give a custom label to each section:\nconst fixName = name =>\n    Promise.resolve(name)\n    .then(tap('start'))\n    .then(name => name.split(' '))\n    .then(tap('after split space'))\n    .then(list => [startCase(list[0]), list[1]])\n    .then(tap('starCase first name'))\n    .then(list => [list[0], startCase(list[1])])\n    .then(tap('starCase last name'))\n    .then(list => `${list[2]}, ${list[0]}`)\n    .then(tap('done'))\n\nIt's a bit more clear when it prints out:\nstart: jesse warden\nafter split space: jesse,warden\nstarCase first name: Jesse,warden\nstarCase last name: Jesse,Warden\ndone: undefined, Jesse\nundefined, Jesse\n\n"},"part10/":{"url":"part10/","title":"Part 10: Testing","keywords":"","body":"Testing\nThere are some problems that are solved by unit testing in Functional Programming, such as not needing mocks and requiring only stubs for dependencies.\nOther problems remain, though.\nStubbing only enough to get the test to pass means you've got the minimally required implementation of the dependency.

Also, as library versions change, public API's may change, so what you had that was correct is now broken in the new version. Finally, are you testing the module and API or implementation details?\nWe'll cover why you don't need mocks, why your stubs still aren't good enough, and a refresher on TDD, property tests, and integration tests with Functional Programming since it often has an Object Oriented Programming slant.\n"},"part10/stubs_and_mocks.html":{"url":"part10/stubs_and_mocks.html","title":"Why We Use Stubs and Not Mocks","keywords":"","body":"Only Stubs, No More Mocks or Spies\nYou don't need mocks in Functional Programming because mocks test side effects. If you're writing Functional code, it is made up of pure functions. Pure functions don't have side effects. So no need for mocks. If you're trying to isolate code, you may still need stubs.\nUnit Test\nA unit test is supposed to be a unit. No one knows (but think they know) what a unit is in programming. For now, a unit is any Object you want to test: Object, class, function, module, whatever.\nObject Under Test\nAn \"object under test\" is the thing you're testing. If you have an it in Jasmine/Mocha in JavaScript or Busted in Lua, or a test_* function Python's PyTest, whatever that test function is supposed to be testing, that's the \"object under test\". Given how Mocks/Spies work, however, it may not be immediately obvious \"what is the actual object under test here?\"\nWhat is a Stub?\nA stub is typically an Object or Function that always does the same thing, typically returning the value you need. If you want your unit tests to be deterministic, and thus dependable, you ensure they always do the same thing every time they run. Given our loadWebsite function:\nconst loadWebsite = request => url => ...\n\nIf we want to stub request to guarantee the test works whether the internet works or not with minimal side effects, you stub it:\nconst requestStub = {\n    get: (url, callback) => callback(undefined, {}, 'hey')\n}\n\nThis stub is mostly a pure function, and we can use it to create a dependable unit test:\nit('loadWebsite should work', ()=> {\n    return loadWebsite(requestStub, 'some url')\n    .then(result => {\n        expect(result).toBe('hey')\n    })\n})\n\nWhat is a Mock?\nMocks are stubs that can track what happened to them during the test execution. You can then make assertions on what they remember. They are sometimes called spies because the Object will record what it sees \"covertly\". Whether using Object Oriented Programming or Functional, the \"how things happen\" is intended to be hidden, so using an Object in this way is considered spying. In Dynamic languages, they'll sometimes re-use a real implementation, and overwrite functions, methods, or properties with temporary Objects unlike statically typed languages where it's wrapped through Composition. This may cause a restore step, where you turn the Object back to the way it was after the test/suite.\nLet's cover post assertions, testing specifically for side effects, and pre-assertions.\nMocks in Post Assertions\nGiven our old school for loop:\nconst getParsedNames = (names, callback) => {\n    for(let i = 0; i \nWe can test what happened to the callback; did it get inside the function and get used like we think it should? To do that, we need a function that remembers what happened to itself.\nconst mockCallback = (...args) => {\n    mockCallback.calls++\n    mockCallback.calledWith.push(args)\n}\nmockCallback.calls = 0\nmockCallback.calledWith = []\n\nNot when we test it, we can make some assertions on it in the test:\nit('getParsedNames should be called with correct parsed names 3 times for 3 item array', ()=> {\n    const names = ['jesse warden', 'brandy fortune', 'albus dumbledog']\n    getParsedNames(names, mockCallback)\n    expect(mockCallback.calls).toBe(3)\n    expect(mockCallback.calledWith[1][0]).toBe('Fortune, Brandy')\n})\n\nCall Something Here, Read About It Over There\nPure function rules are same input, same output, and no side effects. Class methods typically are not pure functions because although they sometimes may have inputs, many don't have return values, and almost always are setting data internally on a mutable this or self property that is the place where all the data internally for the class is stored. While you can write pure functions in a class, and even make them public, if you're using a class, you're going to follow the Object Oriented Programming rule of encapsulation. That is hiding data internally, and exposing access to it from a public API.\nIn a sense, one could argue that a class can be a pure function because it can follow the spirit of the pure function rules:\nclass Adder {\n    add(a, b) => {\n        this._result = a + b\n    }\n    get result() {\n        return this.result\n    }\n}\n\nconst a = new Adder()\na.add(1, 2)\nconsole.log(\"result:\", a.result)\n\nHowever, as soon as you test it, you know you're testing side effects because there:\n\nis no return value\nthe value changes on the object after you set a method\n\nit(\"Adder's add, when called will add 2 numbers\", () => {\n    const instance = new Adder()\n    expect(instance.result).toBe(undefined)\n    const result = instance.add(1, 2)\n    expect(instance.result).toBe(3)\n    expect(result).toBe(undefined)\n})\n\nLet's read those expectations in order:\n\nMake sure the Object's result property is undefined\nMake sure the method has a side effect on the Object.\nMake sure the method didn't return a result.\n\nLet's re-write that as a pure function with test:\nconst add = (a, b) => a + b\n\nit('add will add 2 numbers', () => {\n    const result = add(1, 2)\n    expect(result).toBe(3)\n})\n\nHas a return value, no need to check before and after for side effects.\nPre-programmed Assertions\nTraditionally, mocks are known for pre-programmed assertions. You use them in this way to ensure things are being used as expected... if not, fail the test. Instead of testing how something was used, like a spy, you make your assertions before you even call your object under test. Let's OOP-i-fy our names parser using TypeScript so we can enforce public/private properties and methods:\nimport { startCase } from 'lodash'\n\nexport default class NamesParser {\n\n    private names: Array\n\n    private _parsedNames: Array\n\n    public get parsedNames(): Array {\n        return this._parsedNames\n    }\n\n    constructor(names: Array) {\n        this.names = names\n        this._parsedNames = []\n    }\n\n    private parseName(name) : String {\n        return name.split(' ').reverse().map(startCase).join(', ')\n    }\n\n    public parseNames() {\n        this._parsedNames = []\n        for(let i = 0; i \nFor the unit test, we know it should return a good value, so let's build that assertion into the mock.\nThe one will one will pass because parseName is only being called once for the 1 item in the Array:\nit('NamesParser should call parseName one time for 1 value', () => {\n    const parser = new NamesParser(['jesse warden'])\n    const mock = sinon.mock(parser)\n    mock.expects(\"parseName\").once().throws()\n    parser.parseNames()\n    mock.verify()\n})\n\nThis one fails because we gave it 2 items, but keep the expectation that will will call parseName 1 time:\nit('NamesParser should call parseName one time for 1 value', () => {\n    const parser = new NamesParser(['jesse warden', 'brandy fortune'])\n    const mock = sinon.mock(parser)\n    mock.expects(\"parseName\").once().throws()\n    parser.parseNames()\n    mock.verify()\n})\n\nAgain, test one thing here, but look for the results over there. With Mocks via pre-programmed assertions, you've doing 4 nasty things:\n\nmutating the object under test\ntesting specifically for side effects\nintentionally throwing an Error\nre-mutate the object after the test\n\nWhile 1 and 4 do not follow pure function rules, you get a pass since you're in a dynamic language, and that's one of the reasons we like dynamic languages; everything is fair game. That said, your unit tests are not your actual code anymore; they're modified objects. Number 3, while intentional in unit tests, is not following pure function rules. You give a function inputs and test its outputs. An Error is not an output, it's a side effect. Again, you get a pass because technically it's the mock throwing the error, not your function/class.\n... however, #2 is not ok at all.\nConclusions\nAs you can see, there is zero need for spies/mocks with pure functions because:\n\nno need to mutate the object before or after; it's a function and you use as is\nno need to setup assertions on how something should be used, you're just calling 1 function and checking the outputs are expected based on the inputs\nSide effects?\n\nYou'll assume no side effects, yes, HOWEVER, don't discount testing for them. Using unit tests to test for the LACK OF side effects is actually something unit tests are really good at. If you're not sure if code is 100% pure, unit tests will help you track them down. Just be aware these tests will rot over time, especially if you are testing private module methods. Feel free to delete later vs. maintain them.\nMocks aren't used in Functional Programming because there are no side effects to test for. The Object under test is always a function, so there is no class method or Object property to modify and watch. You're just testing the functions that take inputs and have expected outputs. Some of those inputs may be slow, complicated, or from hard to setup 3rd party code so pure function stubs may be used.\n"},"part10/testing.html":{"url":"part10/testing.html","title":"Testing","keywords":"","body":"Test Driven Development\nCaveat: This section is not promoting Test Driven Development.

That, and you should learn about TDD because multiple smart, experienced people agree it has goodness within despite the various, justified detractors.\nThe Test Driven Development methodology gives uses unit testing as a way to design your code while ensuring you can be confident in constant feature additions and changes.\nHowever, the meaning of TDD over the years has warped into test everything first, and maintain this massive unit test suite full of complicated mocks and stubs, you can't play with ideas at all, or that your code is driven by tests. Once you start bringing in Selenium / functional tests, things got worse.  The much respected David Heinemeier Hansson, known as DHH on Twitter and famous for a variety of things namely creating Ruby on Rails, wrote a pretty scathing blog post on TDD which further clouded the value.\nLet's assume for this post TDD is like Agile: Triggers a maligned attitude at its mere mention, is misunderstood, everyone says they practice it, apparently don't do it right, yet there is some truth is in there somewhere.\nFunctional Programming, while making things easier to unit test, does NOT solve the problems of maintaining large unit test suites, helping you in consulting to convince teams to move from the ice cream cone to the test pyramid or hexagon/honeycomb/hardcore drugs, or ensuring your stubs accurately reflect the concretes they are substituting.\nLike Object Oriented Programming, it follows the same rules that Kent Beck and crew laid out to test the feature. We use the term feature instead of module because Node, Python, and Lua use the term module to imply \"where you put your function(s) and class(es)\". Functional Programming like good Object Oriented code bases and bases in Factorio, benefits from automating everything.\nBelow will cover the false sense of security Functional Programming can give you, how Red Green Refactor is practiced in Functional Programming, and stating the obvious trade offs with using concrete implementations vs. stubs.\nFalse Sense of Security\nFunctional Programming can give you a few false senses of security:\n\nYour test suite size WILL go down\nindividual functions with few arguments are easier to test\nyou'll get 100% test coverage more easily\nyour tests are deterministic and pass consistently\nyour larger test suites can be run concurrently, speeding them up and not breaking because there is no shared state in pure functions\n\nWhile the suite size goes down, a lot of those tests may be testing implementation details and you don't need to test those. Like in OOP, publics test your privates. With 100% test coverage, you'll still get bugs. Stubs are not your concrete implementations; they are different. Consistently passing tests just mean they're consistently missing bugs or consistently having false positives. Functions with a lot of arguments, however, are still hard, have a lot of stubs, and can be just as confusing as large mocks.\nBottom line, even if you no longer get new features, libraries update a lot for security reasons and innovation that changes the public API. You need to change your code even if your code isn't changing. Additionally, no one likes to maintain large test suites, even if they are more understandable in Functional code. This slows you and/or your team down.\nTo end on a happy note, it's a false sense of security, NOT accomplishment. The unit tests, high coverage, and few stubs are something you should be proud of.\nWhat is a Public API?\nWhen we talk about a public API from a Functional Programming perspective, we mean whatever functions are exposed from your module. Now, in Dynamic languages, there often isn't a lot of control here, nor a feature of public, private, nor protected, so you'll do one of the following:\n\nexpose everything\nexpose everything, but name things with underscore prefixes (i.e. thisIsPublic, _thisIsPrivate)\nexpose nothing and use closures only\ncombination of the above using globals and a custom module system\n\nWhat we mean by public API in JavaScript is whatever functions module.exports has on it, or whatever uses the export keyword in ES6. For Python, whatever your folder exposes via __init__.py. For Lua, whatever you return from your module file.\nNow, all 3 of those are modules, but they could import other modules and not expose those internals:\n// string.js\nconst { startCase } = require('lodash')\nconst parseName = name => name.split(' ').reverse().map(startCase).join(', ')\n\nmodule.exports = parseName\n\n// api.js\nconst parseName = require('./string')\n\nmodule.exports = parseName\n\nOur API in this case is the parseName function from the api.js file.\nIf we import parseName from api.mjs, we can use it, but can't access anything else from it, nor from string.js. This controlled level of privacy allows api to only expose things it wants, and change the internals however it wants. This controlled flexibility is good: easier for the developers to get their ideas down in code and folders how they want, yet providing developers using it a consistent API. If the api.js were to change, they'd do a major version change in their package.json so code bases wouldn't break unless those developers are ready to change their code to accommodate the API change.\nThe parseName is a function, but in OOP code bases, it'd be a class, and that class would have only public methods for you to utilize to access the internals however it sees fit. Both OOP and Functional Programming can practice encapsulation. \nTDD: Internal vs. Feature\nTDD is pitched as \"write the test first, make it fail, then fix the code under test to make it pass\". However, that leads to \"every function/class in my code base most likely has a test\". For libraries especially, this may seem ok, but eventually you end up with massive amounts of unit tests usually outnumbering your code because of the stub and/or mock sizes. The problem here is soon as you want to change anything, even if you're not changing the public API, a lot of your tests break. So even if you don't change the public api, you're still having to maintain and modify all of those tests even if your feature doesn't break.\n... and that's what we care about: the feature.\nBoth OOP and FP agree that they don't care about your implementation details, just the public API. However, the public API might not be your feature. You might not even know your public API yet.\nRed, Green, Refactor\nThe following describes how to practice Red, Green, Refactor for Functional Programming. Red Green Refactor is the core way of practicing Test Driven Development.\nStep 1: Failing Feature Unit Test\nTake your feature, and write a unit test for it. Do the bare minimum to get it to compile and then ensure the test fails for the function not returning the right value. For the back-end this could be just 1 module that exports 1 method to \"do all the things\". For front end, this could be unit test verifying you can do the basics in virtual DOM (it doesn't have to be Selenium based).\nStep 2: Write Your Fun Code\nWrite the code that will make the feature work. This should be right side brain fun. Don't stress about 100% function purity, nor worry getting your visual design pixel perfect to the design comps. Use real implementations of libraries instead of stubs/mocks. For front end, get the UI connected to the back-end. For the back-end, get it talking to the database or socket server and showing things in the browser or curl or Postman for REST URL's. This should make your feature test pass.\nNo new tests should be added in this step.\nStep 3: Refactor\nMake the code as pure as you deem appropriate and refactor until your happy. This should be the left brain fun.\nNo new tests should be added in this step.\nRed, Green, Refactor Conclusion\nThe result should be a Red unit test, a Green test after your feature mostly works, and then code you're proud of without breaking the test nor by adding any new tests. When you add a new feature, repeat steps 1, 2, and 3. If you're using code coverage, you'll note that many paths aren't followed unless certain error conditions arise, and that's ok for now. We're interested in the happy path: does the feature work. Unhappy paths, such as login failure, are a feature as well so test those with the same guidelines.\nAPI Example\nLet's do an API example first since it's easier than UI. We need to read a list of users from a relational database. \n\nAs a user,\nI need to see a list of users,\nso that I can better administrate my API\". We'll use Node and Postegres.\n\nStep 1: Red\nOur basic app that currently does nothing but blow up:\nconst startServer = () => Promise.reject(new Error('startServer not implemented yet'))\nconst stopServer = () => Promise.reject(new Error('stopServer not implemented yet'))\n\nmodule.exports = {\n    startServer,\n    stopServer\n}\n\nAnd our Jest unit tests that fail:\nconst request = require('request')\n\nconst { startServer, stopServer } = require('../src/app')\n\nafterEach(() => {\n    return stopServer()\n})\n\ntest('When I call the /users/list API, I should get a list of users', () => {\n    return startServer()\n    .then( () =>\n        new Promise((success, failure) =>\n            request.get('/users/list', (err, res, body) =>\n                err\n                ? failure(err)\n                : success(body)\n    )))\n    .then(users => {\n        expect(users.data[0].firstName).toBe('jesse')\n    })\n})\n\nStep 2: Green\nAfter setting up Postgres with a users table and inserting some data, I then write all the Node code to make it pass:\nconst express = require('express')\nconst app = express()\nconst { Pool } = require('pg')\nconst pool = new Pool()\n\napp.get('/users/list', (req, res) => {\n    return pool.query('SELECT username,date FROM users;')\n    .then(result => result.rows)\n    .then(users => {\n        res.json({result: true, data: users})\n    })\n    .catch(err => {\n        res.json({result: false, error: err.message})\n    })\n})\n\nlet server\n\nconst startServer = () => {\n    return new Promise( resolve => {\n        server = app.listen(3000, () => {\n            resolve(server)\n        })\n    })\n}\nconst stopServer = () =>\n    pool.end()\n    .then(() => {\n        return new Promise((success, failure) => {\n            server.close( err => {\n                if(err) {\n                    return failure(err)\n                }\n                success()\n            })\n        })\n    })\n\nmodule.exports = {\n    startServer,\n    stopServer\n}\n\nRunning npm test works and if I run coverage it's at 90%. To confirm why, we can see from the coverage report that the route and the stopping of the server both have error handling code that our happy path feature doesn't cover.\nStep 3: Refactor\nNow we clean up the code. Let's make the functions mostly pure and add some minor database validation. We'll leave the let for now as our only state.\nconst express = require('express')\nconst { Pool } = require('pg')\nconst Result = require('folktale/result')\nconst { Ok } = Result\nconst Validation = require('folktale/validation')\nconst { Success, Failure } = Validation\nconst { get, partial, memoize, curry } = require('lodash/fp')\n\nconst getPool = () => new Pool()\nconst getPoolCached = memoize(getPool)\n\nconst validRows = o =>\n    Array.isArray(o)\n    ? Success(o)\n    : Failure([`Invalid Rows: Postgres didn't return an Array of rows, instead returned: ${o}`])\n\nconst getUsers = pool =>\n    pool.query('SELECT username,date FROM users;')\n    .then(get('rows'))\n    .then(validRows)\n    .then(validation =>\n        validation.matchWith({\n           Failure: ({value}) => Result.Error(value),\n           Success: ({value}) => Ok(value)\n        }))\n    .catch(error => Promise.resolve(\n        Result.Error(`Postgres Error: ${get('message', error)}`)\n    ))\nconst getUsersPartial = partial(getUsers, [getPoolCached()])\n\nconst sendError = res => error =>\n    res.json({ result: false, error })\n\nconst sendOk = res => data =>\n    res.json({ result: true, data })\n\nconst getUsersRoute = curry( (getUsersPartial, req, res) =>\n    getUsersPartial()\n    .then(result =>\n        result.matchWith({\n            Error: ({value}) => sendError(res)(value),\n            Ok: ({value}) => sendOk(res)(value)\n        })\n    ))\n\nconst getUsersRoutePartial = getUsersRoute(getUsersPartial)\n\nconst addUsersListRoute = app => route =>\n    Ok(\n        app.get('/users/list', route)\n    )\n\nconst listen = port => app =>\n    Result.try(\n        () => app.listen(port)\n    )\n\nlet server\nconst startServer = getUsersRoutePartial => port => app =>\n    addUsersListRoute(app)(getUsersRoutePartial)\n    .chain(_ => listen(port)(app))\n    .chain(newServer => {\n        server = newServer\n        return Result.Ok(server)\n    })\n    .matchWith({\n        Error: ({value}) => Promise.reject(value),\n        Ok: ({value}) => Promise.resolve(server)\n    })\nconst startServerPartial = () => startServer(getUsersRoutePartial)(3000)(express())\n\nconst stopServer = pool =>\n    pool.end()\n    .then( _ => server.close())\nconst stopServerPartial = partial(stopServer, [getPoolCached()])\n\nmodule.exports = {\n    startServer: startServerPartial,\n    stopServer: stopServerPartial\n}\n\nCoverage goes from 90% to 88% because we are not covering the 2 new error scenarios it introduced. Coverage is still helping, though, because it's pointing out areas we can do some more testing on later.\nThe point is, more pure code, easier to test specific parts if you need, API didn't change, and we didn't violate the rules by adding any new tests. Feature still works despite the fact we completely rewrote the internals to be more functional.\nProperty Tests\nProperty tests are unit tests that generate random data. Even if you have greater than 100% unit test coverage, you can miss a certain scenarios:\nconst stringNotBlank = o => o.length > ''\n\nstringNotBlank('cow') // true\nstringNotBlank('') // false\nstringNotBlank() // TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined\n\nTo fix, you have to change it to:\nimport { isString } from 'lodash'\n\nconst stringNotBlank = o => isString(o) && o.length > ''\n\nInstead of trying to ensure you've covered every possible input type, you instead let the computer generate those for you. Also called fuzz tests, they are inspired by Quickcheck from Haskell.\n"}}}

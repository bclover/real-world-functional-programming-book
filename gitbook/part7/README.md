# Identity and Totality

In this section we'll cover some utilities you'll need for more advanced concepts. Specifically the `identity` function and total functions. The `identity` function gives you back what you give it. Identity will help you mainly in composing and in error conditions. Total functions ensure your functions will work with any input. They also help make your code less likely to throw errors and slightly help in them returning the expected results.
